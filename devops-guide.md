## 🧭 What is DevOps?

**DevOps** is a set of practices combining **software development (Dev)** and **IT operations (Ops)** to improve collaboration, automate workflows, and enable faster, more reliable software delivery.

> 🧩 **Goal:** Shorten the software delivery cycle, improve quality, and build a culture of collaboration and accountability.

## 🧱 Core DevOps Principles

- **Collaboration**: Tear down walls between Dev and Ops.
- **Automation**: Streamline everything from builds to infrastructure.
- **Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD)**: Ship fast, ship often.
- **Monitoring & Feedback**: Build in observability and learn from failure.

## 🔧 DevOps Practices Summary

| Practice                    | Description                                     |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **CI/CD**                   | Frequent integration and delivery               |
| **IaC (Infrastructure as Code)** | Declaratively define and manage infrastructure |
| **Monitoring**              | Track metrics, logs, and system health          |
| **Shift Left Testing**      | Test earlier in the development process         |
| **Immutable Infrastructure**| Replace, not modify servers                     |
| **Automated Rollbacks**     | Rollback on failure automatically               |

## 🧠 Culture Matters

- ✅ **Shared Ownership**
- ✅ **Blameless Postmortems**
- ✅ **Fast Feedback Loops**
- ❌ **Silos & Finger-Pointing**
- ❌ **Manual Deployments**

## 🌍 Real-World DevOps Workflow

```plaintext
[Dev Team]
    |
    | Push code to GitHub
    ↓
[CI System (e.g., GitLab CI)]
    |
    | Run tests, build Docker image
    ↓
[Docker Registry (e.g., ECR)]
    |
    | Deploy via Helm chart to Kubernetes
    ↓
[Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)]
    |
    | Alerting via Slack/PagerDuty
```

## 🔍 DevOps vs Traditional IT

| Traditional IT            | DevOps                        |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Manual, infrequent releases | Automated, continuous delivery |
| Siloed teams               | Collaborative teams           |
| Reactive fixes             | Proactive monitoring          |
| Long feedback cycles       | Real-time feedback            |
