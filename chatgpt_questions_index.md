## Ansible on Kubuntu LTS

1. Installing ansible on linux as a control station, should I setup a linux server or can I run it on kubuntu lts

2. explain step 4

3. can I create a host.ini file and would it be available to my ssh connections locally as well as ansible

4. where do I put the hosts.ini file and give me a command I can run in ansible to check the systems in the hosts.ini

5. I need the local control system able to accept ansible command to itself, it looks like ssh isn't setup yet for ansible

6. Ok, I want to run from the ~/Public/ansible-project directory by default for my ansible environment, how would I set that for ansible to run from that directory

7. 2 things I want to do next: clean up my hosts.ini file and 2nd setup ansible as a user for all ansible controlled systems

8. here is my hosts.ini: [all] laptop1 ansible_host=192.168.12.35 ansible_user=david ansible_control ansible_host=192.168.12.63 ansible_user=davidlh  [remote] laptop1  [control] ansible_control  [local] localhost ansible_connection=ssh ansible_user=davidlh

9. ansible user account is asking for password for all managed hosts

10. I haven't been able to ssh-copy-id using ansible, it asks for password. also the last test results: localhost | UNREACHABLE! => {     "changed": false,     "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: ansible@localhost: Permission denied (publickey,password).",     "unreachable": true } laptop1 | UNREACHABLE! => {     "changed": false,     "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: ansible@192.168.12.35: Permission denied (publickey,password).",     "unreachable": true

11. explain and provide steps: If you haven't set a password for the ansible user on those systems yet, you'll need to do that or temporarily allow login via your own user and escalate privileges to configure the ansible user.

12. create an ansible playbook for bootstrapping, also remember I will most likely need to change my host.ini for the host that needs bootstrapping to a current working user because I am unable to do ping with the ansible account due to public key permission denied

13. can I test it with a dry-run first

14. ~/Public/ansible-project$ ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini playbooks/bootstrap-ansible-user.yml --check [WARNING]: Could not match supplied host pattern, ignoring: bootstrap  PLAY [Bootstrap ansible user on managed hosts] ****************************************************************** skipping: no hosts matched

15. PLAY [Bootstrap ansible user on managed hosts] ******************************************************************  TASK [Gathering Facts] ****************************************************************************************** fatal: [laptop1]: UNREACHABLE! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: ansible@192.168.12.35: Permission denied (publickey,password).", "unreachable": true}  PLAY RECAP ****************************************************************************************************** laptop1                    : ok=0    changed=0    unreachable=1    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0

16. --flush-cache is not an option within this version of ansible, also it did not work: ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini playbooks/bootstrap-ansible-user.yml -u david --check --diff  PLAY [Bootstrap ansible user on managed hosts] ******************************************************************  TASK [Gathering Facts] ****************************************************************************************** fatal: [laptop1]: UNREACHABLE! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: ansible@192.168.12.35: Permission denied (publickey,password).", "unreachable": true}  PLAY RECAP ****************************************************************************************************** laptop1                    : ok=0    changed=0    unreachable=1    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0  maybe the become_user=david in the playbook may work then?

17. step 2 worked for us. so can you create a markdown formatted guide for installing and setting up ansible using the successful steps we did here?  include the python interpreter vars cleared some errors for me.  Also include what we need to do to now test ansible on all systems.  Also it looks like ssh for david is passwordless

18. create an ansible playbook to install the following commandline applications:   199  sudo apt install ripgrep   236  sudo apt install htop   240  sudo apt install bat   243  sudo apt install eza   251  sudo apt install jq   267  sudo apt install ncdu   269  sudo apt install asciinema   281  sudo apt install rsync   286  sudo apt install scp   292  sudo apt install fd-find   301  sudo apt install fd-find   311  sudo apt install column   360  sudo apt install tree

19. How do I use groups in ansible hosts.ini

20. using scp can I copy a file to a remote system

21. I now want to install and configure Brave browser using ansible, also make sure we disable the global i386 from installing use apt.  There was a previous post here regarding that, so this yaml file can include updating that setting

22. it failed on downloading key, I think the location of the key is: https://brave.com/signing-keys/#packages-release-channel

23. is it possible to install and configure zsh for a user account, so it may require using -u running ansible-playbook, download 'Hack Regular Nerd Font Complete.ttf' from the ansible controller located in the /home/ansible/Downloads folder.  setup the zsh environment and provide the option to specify the user for that shell environment, also install and configure it to use powerlevel10k theme

24. oh yea include oh-my-zsh

25. I ran this in --check mode, so not sure if the error is supposed to do this: An exception occurred during task execution. To see the full traceback, use -vvv. The error was: If you are using a module and expect the file to exist on the remote, see the remote_src option fatal: [localhost]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Could not find or access '/home/ansible/Downloads/Hack Regular Nerd Font Complete.ttf' on the Ansible Controller.\nIf you are using a module and expect the file to exist on the remote, see the remote_src option"}

26. I updated the src: 'Hack Regular Nerd Font Complete.ttf' because when doing a ls -l on /home/ansible/Downloads/ I see it displayed exactly like that.  I ran it without the check and with -vvv here is the error: The full traceback is: Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ansible/plugins/action/copy.py", line 474, in run     source = self._find_needle('files', source)              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ansible/plugins/action/__init__.py", line 1433, in _find_needle     return self._loader.path_dwim_relative_stack(path_stack, dirname, needle)            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ansible/parsing/dataloader.py", line 351, in path_dwim_relative_stack     raise AnsibleFileNotFound(file_name=source, paths=[to_native(p) for p in search]) ansible.errors.AnsibleFileNotFound: Could not find or access '/home/ansible/Downloads/'Hack Regular Nerd Font Complete.ttf'' on the Ansible Controller.

27. can I change the name and remove the single quotes from the listing and also update the yml with the above information

28. from the install cli .yml I would like to add a few more apps will the playbook ignore the others that are already installed or do I have to reconfigure it to ignore

29. Do you have a good step by step process of installing zsh, oh-my-zsh and powerlevel10k with font Hack Regular Nerd Font Complete.ttf I can use

30. yea create a portable script, can ansible run that script? I know once you open a terminal p10k will run the configuration.

31. How do I run that as adhoc?

32. I'm going to send my ansible-projects directory up to github can you provide the best way to upload it to github

33. I wanted to do the git upload using ssh, so I had to load my id_ed2259 private key in ssh-agent, I also had to configure git configure --global user.email and user.name so can you create a procedure to properly get this up to github?  This is the steps github provided but I still had to address the other issues listed here  ### git repo  echo "# ansible-project" >> README.md git init git add README.md git commit -m "first commit" git branch -M main git remote add origin git@github.com:ireaneus/ansible-project.git git push -u origin main

34. how do I split a file into 2 different files linux.  by line number

35. can you help me configure zsh builtin aliases, when I type alias I get several git aliases that I never really use, then it loads also the aliases from .zshrc which I setup.

36. also the new .vimrc has a scrollbar down the middle when I am in editing in vim can I get rid of that setting

37. I would like a separate ~/.zsh_aliases file

38. I need to configure my server using ansible, I need to include in my cli playbook to install cheat and setup my personal repo to Public/ireaneus-cheatsheets

39. If I already downloaded ireaneus-cheatsheets in the Public directory will it bypass that step

40. yes I will want to setup periodical auto-updates as I make changes to cheat files.  I will ask at a later time

41. schedule that as a task

## Bash Script Logging Example

1. create a simple bash script that will echo a count to a log file, sleeps and continues, so that the log file is active.

2. yes include timestamps and a termination condition, like 3000 lines.  I want to while it is executing I want to truncate the activity log to 1000 lines, while it is running

3. I want a separate script that I can execute while the activity log fills to 3000 lines so I can see the different size, maybe this separate script can read and echo the number of lines that are currently in activity log, and then execute truncate and then echo the number of lines after truncate

4. can you recreate the count_logger.sh script with max lines 3000

5. remove the truncate portion, as I will be using the separate truncate script

6. in the truncate script: 'tail -n "$MAX_LOG_LINES" "$LOG_FILE" > "$LOG_FILE.tmp" && mv "$LOG_FILE.tmp" "$LOG_FILE"' so it creates a tmp file and then moves it to the original file correct?

7. can you create a script (same premise) as the truncate sh. that will tail the last month for a native_stderr.log

8. so I want to truncate native_stderr.log file with only the last month of log entries, it is a 19gig file so it will reduce the original file to only the last month

9. maybe we should stick to the last 500 lines, instead.  that way it is not having to read a 19gig file

10. How do you run a logrotate on the native_stderr.log

11. I need a command to run ls -l and count the number of files in a directory

12. how do I count the number of files in a directory without displaying all lines

13. What is the best method to reduce the /var/log/messages and secure files in RedHat linux

14. for Apache servers there is a large number of old access_log and readwrite.log and other log files in HTTPServer/logs directory, does Apache have a cleanup for that or should we use logrotate for them as well

15. And for RedHat patching, yum clean all is used frequently to clean disk space, is this automatically done after patching, or can you explain the process

16. For RedHat disk usage monitoring, is best practice to have the thresholds for Warning at 90% and critical at 95% or 98%?

17. Do you know what the default values are set to when using instana, or datadog

18. for logrotate is there an option for copytruncate instead of restarting the service, to copy the file and zero it out.  This is for Apache application servers

19. Provide a markdown formatted guide for the content in this post that is visible using glow, also if there is an ability to have glow keep the format markdown visible but allow it to display pages like using more (using more, loses the glow format)

4. What do you call classes you have to take in College that are not related to your major were they refered to as core classes?

7. Also here is the email as well, does your checklist still inline? Your start date will be determined by the client (the VA & ITC) once the background check is complete.  As discussed during the onboard paperwork call, we have several steps, the fingerprinting, eAPP and TMS training.  The final step - once a start date is given will be the completion of the Veteran's Engineering paperwork (I9, W4, Direct Deposit etc).  This will usaually be completed the week prior to the official start date.  Your initial paperwork has been submitted and we are awaiting completion of fingerprinting.  The eAPP will be assigned after the prints have been adjudicated - usually 1-2 weeks after the fingerprint appt.

10. I need to keep in contact and be a squeaky wheel to Veterans Engineering (VE). I want to send "Tray" my checklist for onboarding and need to let him know that I still have not received an email to get fingerprinted.  Should I call and leave a voicemail and how should I format an email with the created checklist to be refined and sent back to me?

His feet were like burnished bronze when it has been heated to a glow in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many waters.

And who is adequate for these things?*  **John 16:8-11**   *And He, when He comes, will convict the world regarding sin, and righteousness, and judgment: 9regarding sin, because they do not believe in Me; 10and regarding righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you no longer are going to see Me; 11and regarding judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.*  **2 Corinthians 4:3-4**   *And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, 4in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they will not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God*  **Romans 1:18-20**   *"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of people who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, 19because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them. 20For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, that is, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, being understood by what has been made, so that they are without excuse."*  **Romans 3:10-12**   *as it is written: ‚ÄúThere is no righteous person, not even one; 11There is no one who understands, There is no one who seeks out God; 12They have all turned aside, together they have become corrupt; There is no one who does good, There is not even one.‚Äù*  ---  ## Salvation **Romans 1:6**   *"For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek."*  **Romans 2:14-16** *"For when Gentiles who do not have the Law instinctively perform the requirements of the Law, these, though not having the Law, are a law to themselves, 15in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them, 16on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of mankind through Christ Jesus."*  **Romans 3:20, 23**    *"because by the works of the Law none of mankind will be justified in His sight; **for through the Law comes knowledge of sin.**"*  23 *"for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,"*  **Romans 5:19**   *"For as through the one man‚Äôs disobedience the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous."*  **John 1010** *"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came so that they would have life, and have it abundantly."*    **Matthew 1519**  ---  ## Conformed to His Image **2 Corinthians 3:18**   *"But we all, with unveiled faces, looking as in a mirror at the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit."*  **Romans 8:29**   *‚ÄúFor those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.‚Äù*  **2 Corinthians 5:17**   *"Therefore if anyone is in Christ, this person is a new creation; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come."*  ---  ## Dying to self **Romans 6:1-13** **Galatians 2:20**  **Romans 520** - grace **2tim215** - rightly dividing the truth  ---  ## Justification **Romans 4:25**   *"He who was delivered over because of our wrongdoings, and was raised because of our justification."*  ---  ## Christian discipline **1 Corinthians 92527** **1 Timothy 416** **philippians 2113** **Hebrews 121** **Ephesians 5** **Galatians 5** **James 48** **matthew51416** **2 Corinthians 617** **1Peter 31516** **Matthew 516** **1 Corinthians 8:9-13**  **1 Peter 3:15-16**   ## Hope Eternal **2 Corinthians 4:18**   *"while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal."*  **Romans 8:24‚Äì25**   *‚ÄúFor in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for who hopes for what he already sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, through perseverance we wait eagerly for it.‚Äù*  ---  ## Absent from the Body **2 Corinthians 5:6-11** *"Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord‚Äî 7for we walk by faith, not by sight‚Äî 8but we are of good courage and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord. 9Therefore we also have as our ambition, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to Him. 10For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive compensation for his deeds done through the body, in accordance with what he has done, whether good or bad."*  ---  ## Ambassadors of Christ **2 Corinthians 5:21-22**   *"Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. 21He made Him who knew no sin to be sin in our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."*  ---  ## Generosity **2 Corinthians 9:6-15**   *"Now I say this: the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one who sows generously will also reap generously. 7Each one must do just as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. 8And God is able to make all grace overflow to you, so that, always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for every good deed; 9as it is written: ‚ÄúHe scattered abroad, he gave to the poor, His righteousness endures forever.‚Äù 10Now He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness; 11you will be enriched in everything for all liberality, which through us is producing thanksgiving to God. 12For the ministry of this service is not only fully supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing through many thanksgivings to God. 13Because of the proof given by this ministry, they will glorify God for your obedience to your confession of the gospel of Christ and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all, 14while they also, by prayer on your behalf, yearn for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you. 15Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!"*  ---  ## Different Gospel **2 Corinthians 11:4**   *"4For if one comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted, this you tolerate very well!"*  **2 Corinthians 13:6**   *"Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith; examine yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you‚Äîunless indeed you fail the test?"*  ---  ## Satan Deceiver **2 Corinthians 11:3, 14**   *"But I am afraid that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his trickery, your minds will be led astray from sincere and pure devotion to Christ."* 14 *"No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light."  **1 John 16** *Adam eve serpent *  **Philippians 2:8** **Hebrews lower than the angels **  ---  ## Sovereignty **Proverbs 16:9**   *"The heart of man plans his way, but the Lord establishes his steps."*  The Bible frequently emphasizes that Jesus is both Savior and Lord, and the two titles are often closely linked to underscore His role in salvation and authority over believers. Here are key verses that highlight this relationship:  1. **Acts 2:36**      *"Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ."*      - This verse identifies Jesus as both the Messiah (Savior) and Lord.  2. **Romans 10:9**      *"If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."*      - Salvation is tied to confessing Jesus as Lord.  3. **Philippians 2:10-11**      *"That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."*      - Jesus is recognized as Lord universally.  4. **Titus 2:13**      *"Looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ."*      - Jesus is referred to as both God and Savior.  5. **2 Peter 1:11**      *"For so an entrance will be supplied to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."*      - The phrase "Lord and Savior" is used together here.  These verses reinforce the biblical truth that Jesus is not just our Savior, but also our Lord, to whom we owe submission and obedience. His saving grace and sovereign lordship are inseparable in the Christian faith.  ## Spirit filled, living by faith **Proverbs 33:20-22** *Our soul waits for the LORD; He is our help and our shield. For our heart rejoices in Him, Because we trust in His holy name. Let Your favor, LORD, be upon us, Just as we have waited for You.*  Comparison with Other Scriptures on Trusting and Waiting on God  Psalm 33:20-22 teaches us about waiting on the Lord, trusting in His name, and experiencing His steadfast love. These themes appear throughout Scripture, reinforcing the call to rely on God‚Äôs sovereignty and faithfulness.   ---  1. Trusting God as Our Help and Shield  Psalm 18:2 (NASB 2020)  > ‚ÄúThe Lord is my rock and my fortress and my Savior, My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.‚Äù    Like Psalm 33:20, this verse describes God as both a shield (protector) and a place of refuge.  Application: When we face trials, we must take active refuge in God, not just acknowledge Him from a distance.   Proverbs 30:5 (NASB 2020)  > ‚ÄúEvery word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.‚Äù    Reinforces that God‚Äôs shielding protection is tied to trusting in His Word.    ---  2. Waiting on the Lord with Expectation  Isaiah 40:31 (NASB 2020)  > ‚ÄúYet those who wait for the Lord Will gain new strength; They will mount up with wings like eagles, They will run and not get tired, They will walk and not become weary.‚Äù    "Wait for the Lord" in Hebrew (qavah) means to hope with expectation.  Those who wait on God are renewed in strength, just as Psalm 33:20 declares that He is our help.   Lamentations 3:25-26 (NASB 2020)  > ‚ÄúThe Lord is good to those who wait for Him, To the person who seeks Him. It is good to wait quietly For the salvation of the Lord.‚Äù    Similar to Psalm 33:22, this passage connects waiting with receiving God‚Äôs goodness.    ---  3. Rejoicing in God Because of Trust  Philippians 4:4-7 (NASB 2020)  > ‚ÄúRejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice! Let your gentle spirit be known to all people. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and pleading with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.‚Äù    Like Psalm 33:21, joy comes from trusting God, not circumstances.  Peace comes when we trust instead of being anxious.    ---  4. The Relationship Between God's Favor and Waiting  Psalm 5:12 (NASB 2020)  > ‚ÄúFor You bless the righteous person, Lord, You surround him with favor as with a shield.‚Äù    Like Psalm 33:22, God‚Äôs favor is linked to trust and obedience.   Psalm 37:7-9 (NASB 2020)  > ‚ÄúRest in the Lord and wait patiently for Him; Do not get upset because of one who is successful in his way, Because of the person who carries out wicked schemes. Cease from anger and abandon wrath; Do not get upset; it leads only to evildoing. For evildoers will be eliminated, But those who wait for the Lord, they will inherit the land.‚Äù    Patience in waiting leads to blessing, just as Psalm 33:22 says, ‚ÄúLet Your favor be upon us, just as we have waited for You.‚Äù    ---  5. Connection to Psalm 46:10 ("Be Still and Know That I Am God")  Psalm 46:10 calls believers to be still and recognize God‚Äôs sovereignty.  Psalm 33:20-22 shows how this plays out: we wait, trust, and rejoice in God‚Äôs name.    ---  Key Takeaways   ---  Final Reflection  Psalm 33:20-22 is a powerful reminder that waiting on the Lord is not passive‚Äîit is an active trust in God‚Äôs sovereignty, leading to joy, protection, and His favor. Other passages throughout Scripture confirm this, showing that trust, patience, and faith bring strength and blessing.

## 1 Chronicles 21 Parallel

1. Is 1 Chronicles 21 story told somewhere else

2. Based on the reformers commentaries why are these stories retold in 2 Samuel and 1 Chronicles and why are there numerical differences

3. I want to write a gospel sharing short presentation, that I can get the subject about God and then present the Gospel.  I have notes can you help write something up? --- title: I am a sinner date: 11-17-2024 ---  # I am a Sinner  #### General notes - I am and you are sinners, we sin because we are sinners.  A lion kills its prey, because he is a lion, it is his nature - How do we want to meet God, do we believe He is our own making. - How many religions are in the world. - What is truth - We were formed in our mothers womb - Jesus is the only one to claim to be the Son of God - He is the only one that was resurrected, and it was for our justification  #### Scripture references - Romans 1:17-18 - Ephesians 1 and 2 - Romans 8 and 9 - Genesis 3:8 God showing mercy and love, or instant judgement - Psalms 51 you only have I sinned

4. I would like it in question format to the unbeliever.  There are 2 evidences that I work from, the conscience and the creation (Romans 1, towards the end of the chapter). Working from those.  When I tell them they are a sinner, they already know that.  God has given them a conscience.  How would the reformers put together a short conversation regarding sharing the gospel to the lost, using Spurgeon, Calvin, Luther, Sproul and John MacCarther

5. ## What do you do? **Me:** *I am a full-time RV Missionary.*   **Person:** *What does that mean?*   **Me:** *I live in an RV and travel around and try to share the gospel and pray with people wherever I go* **Person:** *What is does the gospel mean?*

6. Using the scripture references, and filling them out in NASB1995, can you create a scripture reading small message about being sinners saved by grace.  The primary illustration should be around Gen 3:8 about God's great love and mercy.  The backdrop to this is the song Christ alone by Michael English

7. Can you review this summary statement I made, I didn't complete the thought can you help? *"Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings. 8They heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. 9Then the Lord God called to the man, and said to him, ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù 10He said, ‚ÄúI heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself."*  I could talk about the conversation Eve had with the serpent, but that would take up PAstor Wayne's sermon. However these 3 verses, is heart breaking, the very moment Adam chose to disobey his Creator. Do you notice that God made noise when He walked to meet with them.  It provided an opprotunity to hid from Him, their guilt, shame and nakedness was great and they needed to hide.  But God persude them, and called out to them Where are you.

8. I want to convey all three parts of these verses, 1 the weight of sin, guilt shame and nakedness before our creator. 2 God's loving mercy as He announces His presence, like the whisper Elijah experienced, gentle. 3. His persuit in redeeming us and restoring us through Jesus Christ.  Can you find more supporting scripture references for these three parts of these verses.  I really want to convey the heaviness of the disobedience of the sin of Adam.  Can we focus on these three verses again, Let the story sink in. If you picture it, it is truly heartbreaking. This is the very moment Adam chose to disobey his Creator, forever changing the human condition.   ### A Heart of Repentance David‚Äôs confession in **Psalm 51:4 (NASB1995)** says:   *"Against You, You only, I have sinned and done what is evil in Your sight, so that You are justified when You speak and blameless when You judge."*  Do you notice that God made His presence known as He walked through the garden? His steps gave Adam and Eve an opportunity to hide, an instinct driven by the immense guilt, shame, and sense of nakedness that now overwhelmed them.    Yet, even in their broken state, God pursued them. He didn‚Äôt abandon them in their sin but instead called out, ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù This simple question reveals a profound truth: even when we hide in shame, God seeks us out in love, desiring restoration and reconciliation.  ### God‚Äôs Grace and Mercy Listen to **Ephesians 2:4-5 (NASB1995)**:   *"But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved)."*  ### The Weight of Our Sin **Romans 1:18 (NASB1995)** tells us:   *"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness."*   ### Christ Alone, Our Hope and Salvation *"Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."*  Jesus bore the punishment we deserved, satisfying God‚Äôs wrath so that we could be forgiven. And His resurrection proves that we are justified, declared righteous in God‚Äôs sight.

9. Under the paragraph for Let the story sink in.  Add O wretched man that I am and Psalm 51

10. I forgot the 1st part:  ## Sinners Saved by Grace  ### Scripture Reading and Message Good Morning, I am a sinner. You all are sinners, everyone that has ever lived and is now living are sinners. You know it, and I know it. We often avoid the topic of sin. It‚Äôs uncomfortable to talk about, but it‚Äôs fundamental fact and it makes understanding the Gospel is much more rich than we can ever know. The reality is we sin because we are sinners‚Äîit's part of our nature. Just as a lion hunts and kills because that‚Äôs what a lion does, we sin because it is in our very nature to do so.

11. Good Morning, I am a sinner. You all are sinners; everyone who has ever lived and is now living is a sinner. You know it, and I know it. We often avoid the topic of sin. It‚Äôs uncomfortable to talk about, but it‚Äôs a fundamental fact, and it makes understanding the Gospel much richer than we can ever fully comprehend. The reality is, we sin because we are sinners‚Äîit‚Äôs part of our nature. Just as a lion hunts and kills because that‚Äôs what a lion does, we sin because it is in our very nature to do so.  Good Morning, I capatalize the G and the M, because of "Good" I acknowledge "no one is good but the One who sent me" (verse), and M for the "Bright Morning Star" (verse).  I am acknowledging and proclaiming only He is Good

12. help, These three verses capture one of the top most heartbreaking moments in Scripture, the other is when Jesus crys out, why God have you forsaken me (verse and God crush verse). The very instant Adam chose to disobey his Creator, sin entered the world and forever changed the human condition. The burden of that moment echoes throughout humanity.

13. where is the story of David in Scriptures

## Personal Statement of Faith

1. I am writing a personal statement of Faith document, it will be based on biblical interpretation, using the NASB as the cornerstone.  The foundation will built around "The chief end of man, the Sovereignty of God, the 5 Solas, the great commission.  I will be breaking it into sections and sentences that are referencing a verse it will have that listed.  Also my statements of faith will be like the New Testament writers that fill in their letters quoting scripture

2. for the chief end of man, there is a verse that speaks of being completely satisfied in Him, surrender to the cross?

3. can you display the lyrics to Steve Camp's song 'Livin dangerously'

4. Is this format acceptable or can you provide a format that is consistent to statements of faith, I don't want it to be my words that speak of my statement but that of scripture: ### My Chief End in Life #### I believe that *the chief end of man is to glorify God, and to enjoy Him forever* - *"For He has satisfied the thirsty soul, and the hungry soul He has filled with what is good."(Psalm 107:9)*.  - *"You will make known to me the path of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy; in Your right hand there are pleasures forever."(Psalm 16:11)* - *"Whom have I in heaven but You? And besides You, I desire nothing on earth. My flesh and my heart may fail, But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever."(Psalm 73:25-26)* - *"Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God." (1 Corinthians 10:31)* - *"The conclusion, when all has been heard, is: fear God and keep His commandments, because this applies to every person." (Ecclesiastes 12:13)*

5. Thank for a perfect start to my statement.  I have a long definition for what I believe about the Bible can you help me use the same format and shorten my Bible statement?  Statement of Faith: The Bible I believe that the Bible is God's written revelation to mankind, consisting of the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments, inspired by the Holy Spirit, and forming the plenary (inspired equally in all parts) and verbally inspired Word of God (2 Peter 1:20-21). These Scriptures are absolutely inerrant, infallible, and immutable in their original form, serving as God‚Äôs perfect revelation to humanity (2 Timothy 3:16).  I affirm the literal, grammatical-historical method of interpretation, which upholds the belief that the opening chapters of Genesis present creation in six literal days (Genesis 1:31; Exodus 31:17), and that all Scripture is to be understood in its proper context as guided by the Holy Spirit (John 16:12-15). Along with the six literal days, the Bible can be interpreted literally, for example, Judas leaving before the institution of communion (John 13:26-30), the three days and three nights that Jesus spent in the grave (Matthew 12:40), the timing of His crucifixion to coincide with the national Passover lamb sacrifice (John 19:14), and the three hours of literal darkness across the earth during His death (Matthew 27:45).  I believe that the Bible constitutes the only infallible rule of faith and practice, eternally relevant and authoritative over all aspects of life (Matthew 5:18; John 17:17). I believe that God spoke through human authors by a process of dual authorship, ensuring His message was perfectly conveyed without error in the whole or in part (2 Peter 1:20-21). While there may be many applications of any given passage, there is but one true interpretation. It is the responsibility of believers to ascertain carefully the true intent and meaning of Scripture.  Scripture References:  2 Timothy 3:16-17 ‚Äì "All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work." 2 Peter 1:20-21 ‚Äì "But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one‚Äôs own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God." Matthew 5:18 ‚Äì "For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished." John 17:17 ‚Äì "Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth." Genesis 1:31 ‚Äì "God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day." John 19:14 ‚Äì "Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, 'Behold, your King!'"

6. I plan to break up the nature of God into the trinity, father, son and holy spirit but I need a general statement talking about the nature and attributes of God: ### The Nature of God  I believe that God is eternal, infinite, and unchanging, existing as one essence in three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient, possessing all knowledge, power, and authority. God is perfectly holy, just, and righteous, without sin or imperfection. He is good and merciful, the source of all truth, and sovereign over all creation. God is self-existent, having no cause, and He is the ultimate standard of all that is right and just. His nature is fully revealed in His Word, through His actions in history, and supremely in the person of Jesus Christ.  ### Key Attributes of God: - **Eternal**: God has no beginning or end (Psalm 90:2). - **Infinite**: God is without limits or boundaries (Jeremiah 23:24). - **Immutable**: God never changes (Malachi 3:6). - **Omnipotent**: God is all-powerful (Job 42:2). - **Omnipresent**: God is present everywhere (Psalm 139:7-10). - **Omniscient**: God knows all things (Isaiah 46:9-10). - **Holy**: God is perfectly set apart from all sin (Isaiah 6:3). - **Just**: God is perfectly righteous in all His judgments (Deuteronomy 32:4). - **Good**: God is the source of all goodness (Psalm 34:8). - **Sovereign**: God rules over all creation with supreme authority (Psalm 103:19). - **Self-existent**: God exists independently of anything else (Exodus 3:14).

7. Yes can you help with the nature of God in the Trinity:   I believe in one God who exists eternally in three distinct persons‚ÄîFather, Son, and Holy Spirit‚Äîwho are co-equal in essence, nature, and attributes. These three persons of the Godhead share the same divine nature and operate in perfect unity, without division or separation. Each person of the Trinity is fully God, yet there is only one God. God is Spirit, infinite, and transcendent, and though He is actively involved in creation, He is not confined by physical space or human limitations.

8. Yes I would like help with the other individual roles, but first I would like to include a statement about the trinity that speaks of their Holiness individually, example when revelation says Holy, Holy, Holy it is referring to Father Son and Holy Spirit

9. yes lets start with the Father, this is what I have for that:

10. ### The Nature of God: God the Father  I believe that God the Father, the first Person of the Trinity, orders and disposes all things according to His own purpose and grace (Psalm 145:8-9; 1 Corinthians 8:6). He is the Creator of all things (Genesis 1:1-31; Ephesians 3:9) and the only absolute and omnipotent Ruler of the universe. He exercises sovereignty in creation, providence, and redemption (Psalm 103:19; Romans 11:36). His fatherhood involves both His eternal role within the Trinity and His relationship with humanity. As Creator, He is the Father of all men (Ephesians 4:6), but He is the spiritual Father only to believers (Romans 8:14; 2 Corinthians 6:18). He has decreed all things that come to pass for His own glory (Ephesians 1:11).  God continually upholds, directs, and governs all creatures and events (1 Chronicles 29:11). In His sovereignty, He is neither the author nor the approver of sin (Habakkuk 1:13; John 8:38-47), and He does not diminish the moral accountability of His intelligent creatures (1 Peter 1:17). From eternity past, He graciously chose those whom He would adopt as His own, to the praise of His glory (Ephesians 1:4-6). He saves from sin all who come to Him through Jesus Christ and, upon adoption, becomes Father to His redeemed (John 1:12; Romans 8:15; Galatians 4:5; Hebrews 12:5-9).  - **Key Scriptures**:     - John 6:38 ‚Äì *"For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me."*    - Ephesians 1:3-6 ‚Äì *"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him."*    - 1 Corinthians 8:6 ‚Äì *"Yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things and we exist for Him."*

11. Can we start again with the chief end of man, instead of scripture first, can we mix the scripture in the the statement.

12. yes, I would like to try that

13. Can you rephrase this, it should convey that based on the one interpretation comes many applications and revealed will should be a scripture, 1 or 2 corinthians, talking about God's perfect will?

14. While there may be various applications of a passage, there is but one true interpretation. Believers are called to discern the true meaning of Scripture, guided by the Holy Spirit in understanding God‚Äôs revealed will.

15. somewhere in the epistles there is a verse that talks about 3 aspects of God's will

16. so that should be included in that statement, it should be something like: there is but one interpretation and based on that interpretation there are many applications again based on the interpretation, believers that they may prove what the will of God is...

17. How should I display the attributes of God?  ### **Key Attributes of God**: - **Eternal**: *"Before the mountains were born or You gave birth to the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God." (Psalm 90:2)*   - **Infinite**: *"Can a man hide himself in hiding places so I do not see him? declares the Lord. Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?" (Jeremiah 23:24)*   - **Immutable**: *"For I, the Lord, do not change." (Malachi 3:6)*   - **Omnipotent**: *"I know that You can do all things, and that no purpose of Yours can be thwarted." (Job 42:2)*   - **Omnipresent**: *"Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?" (Psalm 139:7-10)*   - **Omniscient**: *"I am God, and there is no one like Me, declaring the end from the beginning." (Isaiah 46:9-10)*   - **Holy**: *"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory." (Isaiah 6:3)*   - **Just**: *"The Rock, His work is perfect, for all His ways are just." (Deuteronomy 32:4)*   - **Good**: *"Taste and see that the Lord is good; How blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!" (Psalm 34:8)*   - **Sovereign**: *"The Lord has established His throne in the heavens, and His sovereignty rules over all." (Psalm 103:19)*   - **Self-existent**: *"I AM WHO I AM." (Exodus 3:14)*

18. Lets keep going, doing very well

19. Can you provide the same for this section?  ## The Nature of God: The Trinity - *"Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one!" (Deuteronomy 6:4)*   - *"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit." (Matthew 28:19)*   - *"For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one." (1 John 5:7)*   - *"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all." (2 Corinthians 13:14)*  There is only one God who exists eternally in three distinct persons‚ÄîFather, Son, and Holy Spirit. Each is perfectly holy, deserving of worship, and worthy of all glory and honor. In the heavenly vision of Revelation, God is praised as "Holy, Holy, Holy," a threefold proclamation that reflects the holiness of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  Though distinct in person, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are united in their divine essence and nature. They are co-equal in their attributes of holiness, justice, and mercy, revealing the fullness of God's perfect character.  ---  ### **Scriptural Basis for the Trinity**: - **One God**: *"Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one!" (Deuteronomy 6:4)*   - **Three Persons**: *"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit." (Matthew 28:19)*   - **Unity in Essence**: *"For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one." (1 John 5:7)*   - **Distinct Persons in Relationship**: *"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all." (2 Corinthians 13:14)*

20. special section for the holiness of the trinity ### **The Holiness of the Trinity** - *"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come." (Revelation 4:8)*   - *"And one called out to another and said, 'Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory.'" (Isaiah 6:3)*  Each person of the Trinity‚ÄîFather, Son, and Holy Spirit‚Äîis perfectly holy, set apart from all creation in absolute purity and moral perfection. The triune God is praised in heaven as "Holy, Holy, Holy," emphasizing the infinite holiness of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Together, they are co-equal in their divine holiness, and their nature is the source and standard of all that is holy.  ### Scriptural Support for the Holiness of Each Person: - **The Holiness of the Father**:     *"Your eyes are too pure to approve evil, and You cannot look on wickedness with favor." (Habakkuk 1:13)*   - **The Holiness of the Son**:     *"But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot." (1 Peter 1:19)*   - **The Holiness of the Holy Spirit**:     *"Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? ... For the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are." (1 Corinthians 3:16-17)*

21. ## **The Nature of God: God the Father** - *"For us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things and we exist for Him." (1 Corinthians 8:6)*   - *"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him." (Ephesians 1:3-4)*   - *"The Lord has established His throne in the heavens, and His sovereignty rules over all." (Psalm 103:19)*  God the Father, the first person of the Trinity, is the sovereign Creator of all things, ordaining all things according to His will and purpose. He exercises authority over all creation, providence, and redemption. His fatherhood is twofold: He is the Creator and Father of all men (Ephesians 4:6), but He is the spiritual Father only to those who are in Christ, adopted into His family through faith (Romans 8:14-15).  God the Father has decreed all things for His glory and continually upholds and governs all creatures and events (1 Chronicles 29:11). In His holiness, He neither authors nor approves sin, and He preserves the moral accountability of His creation (Habakkuk 1:13). From eternity, He graciously chose those whom He would adopt as His children to the praise of His glorious grace (Ephesians 1:4-6).

22. Can you list out the 'Decrees of God' from the Bible are they different from the 'Works of God the Father' and if so can you list out them as well, with scripture references

23. Based on these can you provide statements for them: What do you believe about the works of God? - Decrees

24. This is the statement from an instructor about the decree of God, referred to Concepts:  Eternal decrees are those ordinances by which God, in His perfect wisdom, determined to accomplish His purpose. ‚Ä¢ From eternity, God has had an unchangeable plan____ with regard to His creation. Ephesians 1:4; 2 Timothy 1:9 ‚Ä¢ God comprehends and determines___ all things and events that come to pass. Ephesians 1:11; Proverbs 21:1; Philippians 2:13 ‚Ä¢ However, God does not sin! ‚Ä¢ God does allow sin, but He always superintends___ it for His own perfect purpose. Acts 2:23; Job 1:12; Acts 4:27-28 ‚Ä¢ All God‚Äôs decrees are unconditional and sovereign. ‚Ä¢ God‚Äôs decrees are by no means dependent on human action. ‚Ä¢ The end that God has in view will inevitably come to pass. Daniel 4:35; Ephesians 1:5; Romans 9 ‚Ä¢ The decrees of God are efficacious. Nothing can ever prevent God‚Äôs will! ‚Ä¢ The decrees of God are always perfectly consistent with His holy nature. Habakuk 1:13

25. with regard to Soterialogy what is the General calling, and the effectual calling. Provide complete scripture reference for both

26. **What does the General call look like, and the Effectual call look like**  ## The General call **Scripture references** - Matt 20:16 - Matt 22:14  ## The effectual call **Scripture references** - John 10:27 - John 6:66-69 - Acts 2:1-40 - John 3:3 - Rom 10:17

27. I need a similar statement about "What I believe about angels" based on scripture and with the notes from my instructor: Angels Described ‚Ä¢ The term ‚Äòangel‚Äô means a messenger___. o Does not necessarily mean the class of spiritual beings now being considered. o In Revelation 2 - 3, for example, it is more likely that Jesus is addressing the pastors___ of the seven churches. ‚Ä¢ The angels we are considering are spiritual, created___ beings. o They are not eternal. o They were created by God at some point, certainly before___ humans were created. ‚Ä¢ In some places, sons of God might___ refer to angels. Job 1:6 o This is not to equate them with the eternal Son of God. o It may simply refer to creatures created by God. ‚Ä¢ They are called the Host___ of Heaven. 2 Chronicles 18:18; Psalms 148:2; Luke 2:13 Origin of Angels ‚Ä¢ Created by God.

29. What do I believe about the nature of man? Anthropology defined: ‚Ä¢ The study of humankind____, past and present. ‚Ä¢ Biblical anthropology is the study of humankind as it relates to God____. The Bible tells us that man was specially created in the image and likeness of God. Genesis 1:26-27 ‚Ä¢ This is often referred to by the Latin Imago Dei, which means the image____ of God. ‚Ä¢ In the original Hebrew, it is tselem, which can be translated as image, likeness, resemblance, a representative figure. ‚Ä¢ Tselem is not____ an exact duplicate; it represents the original in an imprecise manner, so man was not created equal to God. o God‚Äôs image in us lacks the reality____ of the original. o But God made man in such a way as to reflect____ some of His own perfections. o Originally, humans were created to be perfect in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, exercising dominion____ over the creatures on Earth. Genesis 1:26‚Äì1:27 Contrasting Views Regarding the Nature of God‚Äôs Image in Man. ‚Ä¢ Substantive View: God‚Äôs image consists in a definite physical, intellectual, and spiritual way within the nature of man. ‚Ä¢ Tends to define God in terms of man___, which is not a good idea. ‚Ä¢ Physical characteristics of man are irrelevant because God is Spirit___. John 4:24 ‚Ä¢ Functional View: the image of God is speaking to what man does. ‚Ä¢ God rules the universe___ and God ordained man to rule (have dominion) over the creation on Earth. Genesis 1:26 ‚Äì 28 ‚Ä¢ This is problematic in that God created man in His image before___ He gave man dominion over creation. Therefore, there must be more to God‚Äôs image than just dominion. ‚Ä¢ Relational View: when we interact by faith with Jesus Christ (in relationship with Him), we have the image of God restored___ in us. 2 Corinthians 3:18 ‚Ä¢ Problematic in that unregenerate___ people retain at least some of God‚Äôs image in them. Genesis 9:6; James 3:9 ‚Ä¢ Reformed View: God‚Äôs likeness in man is an intellectual, spiritual, moral and social likeness. Psalms 8:4-9; 1 Corinthians 15:42-49; Ephesians 4:22-24; Colossians 3:9-10 ‚Ä¢ Combines elements of all three viewpoints already discussed. ‚Ä¢ The image of God in man is obscured___, but not destroyed by sin. ‚Ä¢ In Christ, the image of God is restored, imperfectly___ in this life, but perfectly at Christ‚Äôs second coming.

30. Based on this document Session 7 all parts, can you provide what I believe about the nature of man.  Provide quotes of scriptures in the summary

31. can you provide the quotes of scripture relevent in the summary

32. I really like this format! Please provide the same format for the Angels, and Satan statements

33. Where does Psalms 135:5-7 fit in my statement of faith

34. Based on this chat session and the attached document, and the whole of Scripture (NASB1995) and using the same format of "What I believe about the nature of man" please provide "What I believe about Sin"

35. The section for the chief end of man can you incorporate the meaning of Isaiah 43:6-7 also any other verse that speaks of God's glory

36. Can it be less commentary and more scripture verses

37. Can I get the description of God's glory to be included and remove the last paragraph. God's Glory is Great: Psalm 138:5 God's Glory is Eternal: Psalm 104:31 God's Glory is Rich: Ephesians 3:16 God's Glory is Highly exalted: Psalm 8:1, 113:4

38. The last paragraph is the direction I want to go with, I know John Piper has a famous quote, is there more scriptures that speak of us having satisfaction in Him, I know 1 Cor. 10:31 is the cornerstone of this statement, but I want it near the end.  But more on the satisfaction of us found in Him

39. Here is the version I came up with, I don't want repeated words, and it should be a personal Statement of Faith entry: I believe that the chief end of man is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever. We were created to find our ultimate satisfaction in God, "For He has satisfied the thirsty soul, and the hungry soul He has filled with what is good." (Psalm 107:9). Our deepest joy and fulfillment are found in Him alone, "Delight yourself in the Lord; and He will give you the desires of your heart." (Psalm 37:4). The longing of the human heart is ultimately satisfied in God's presence, "In Your presence is fullness of joy; in Your right hand there are pleasures forever." (Psalm 16:11).  God Himself is the source of all that is truly good and fulfilling, "O taste and see that the Lord is good; how blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!" (Psalm 34:8). The Scriptures remind us that our souls are restless until they find their rest in God, "My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; when shall I come and appear before God?" (Psalm 42:2). True life is found only in knowing and loving God, "Whom have I in heaven but You? And besides You, I desire nothing on earth. My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever." (Psalm 73:25-26).  The call to glorify God encompasses all aspects of life, "Whatever you do, do all to the glory of God." (1 Corinthians 10:31). As we seek our satisfaction in Him, we fulfill our purpose, bringing glory to God and enjoying the fullness of life He offers.

40. What I believe about Salvation, according to the notes in the attached document, also it is called Sorotology I think: Include scripture references below: ### **Salvation** I believe that "Salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, according to Scripture alone, to the glory of God alone" - **Scripture References**:   - *Ephesians 2:8-9* ‚Äì "For by grace you have been saved through faith."   - *Titus 3:5* ‚Äì "He saved us... according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration."   - *Romans 5:1* ‚Äì "Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God."  ### **Salvation** Salvation is a gift of **God's grace** through faith in **Jesus Christ alone**. It is not based on human works but on the redemptive work of Christ. Believers are justified by faith and adopted as children of God. - **Key Scriptures**: Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:23-24; John 3:16

41. based on this document can you provide a statement of Faith of "What I believe about the Church?"

42. What do I believe about Heaven and Hell

43. What do I believe about the Resurrection?  I believe that the Rapture is a multi stage event, in where it should be called the Resurrection in 1 Thess 4:13-17. The dead in Christ will rise with a resurrected bodies, and the ones alive will be caught up together with them, our bodies changed in a twinkling of an eye, and we will go through the Bema seat of Jesus during this same event

44. The last trumpet refers to the Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year) and its last horn that is blown (there is multiple trumpet blows during this celebration correct?

45. Can you incorporate that into my What I believe about the Resurrection statement

46. Based on all the attached and the NASB1995 version of the Holy Scriptures can you provide What I believe about the Judgement statement?

47. The first paragraph should reference something that speaks of all encompassing everyone will face judgement, the scripture reference is for the believer only.  Also for the rewards of the believer please reference the verse that speaks about God prepared beforehand the works of the saints

48. The nature of God's judgement needs to be rewritten, I like the Righteousness sentence and verse, however His Judgement nature is also Holy, He cannot tolerate or be in the presence of sin, He is a Just God, Holy and Blameless

49. What I believe about Messiah Second Coming?

50. I corrected the mistakes in the last post, His second coming is different from the Rapture and the scriptures referring to the Saints are not relevent to the 2nd coming.  Here is a statement I did for the Second coming can you help revise it? ### **The Second Coming of the Messiah**  I believe that the Second Coming of **Jesus Christ, the Messiah**, will come at a time when it is not anticipated. *"For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night."* **(1 Thessalonians 5:2)**. His return will be visible, physical in bodily form, just as He ascended, *"They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory."* **(Matthew 24:30)**., and triumphant *"For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes even to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be."* **(Matthew 24:27)**. bringing final judgment "When the Son of Man comes in His glory... He will sit on His glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered before Him; and He will separate them one from another." (Matthew 25:31-32), establishing His kingdom "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ; and He will reign forever and ever." (Revelation 11:15), "And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone." (Revelation 20:10), and fulfilling God‚Äôs redemptive plan"Looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus." (Titus 2:13.

51. What do I believe about eternity

52. Do you have access to christian creeds?

53. Based on my statement about the Chief end of Man, and the forementioned creeds, and  ### **Providence** I believe in the **providence of God**, whereby He governs all events, both big and small, according to His eternal plan. Even though I am responsible for my actions, God's providential care directs my path.  He is a personal God, intimately involved with His creation, nothing passes by outside His Will. - **Scripture References**:   - *Psalm 139:7-10* ‚Äì "Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?"   - *Proverbs 16:9* ‚Äì "The mind of man plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps." Can you build me a creed statement to replace the Chief end of man section of my statement of faith, make it about 3 or 4 paragraphs long, referencing creed statements, and scripture verses with the verses italicized, and the references bolded

54. Can you make the following statements in a Chiastic structure? ## The Chief End of Man  I believe that the chief end of man is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever, created for our ultimate satisfaction in Him, *"For He has satisfied the thirsty soul, and the hungry soul He has filled with what is good."* **(Psalm 107:9)**. True joy and fulfillment are found in the Lord, *"Delight yourself in the Lord; and He will give you the desires of your heart."* **(Psalm 37:4)**. The deepest longings of the human heart are met in God's presence, *"In Your presence is fullness of joy; in Your right hand there are pleasures forever."* **(Psalm 16:11)**.  God is the source of all that is truly good and satisfying, *"O taste and see that the Lord is good; how blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!"* **(Psalm 34:8)**. Our hearts remain restless until they find peace in God, *"My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; when shall I come and appear before God?"* **(Psalm 42:2)**. Life's true meaning is found in knowing and loving Him, *"Whom have I in heaven but You? And besides You, I desire nothing on earth. My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever."* **(Psalm 73:25-26)**.  The call to glorify God extends to every part of life, *"Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."* **(1 Corinthians 10:31)**. In seeking our fulfillment in Him, we accomplish our highest purpose, bringing honor to God and experiencing the abundant life He offers.  ### **Creed on the Purpose and Providence of God**  I believe that the chief end of man is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever, as affirmed by the Scriptures and the early creeds of the Church. God has created all things for His glory, including humanity, whom He fashioned in His own image to reflect His greatness and goodness. *"For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever."* **(Romans 11:36)**. *"Bring My sons from afar and My daughters from the ends of the earth, everyone who is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory."* **(Isaiah 43:6-7)**.  In line with the Apostles‚Äô Creed and the Nicene Creed, I confess God as Creator of heaven and earth and as the One who, by His providence, upholds and directs all things. I believe in His sovereign rule over the entire universe, from the vastness of the cosmos to the smallest details of our lives. *"In Him we live and move and have our being."* **(Acts 17:28)**. Although humanity is responsible for its actions, nothing happens apart from God's will and eternal purposes, as He works all things according to the counsel of His will. *"The mind of man plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps."* **(Proverbs 16:9)**.  I affirm that God‚Äôs providential care is personal and constant, guiding the lives of His people in ways both visible and unseen. His presence is never distant, as the psalmist declares, *"Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?"* **(Psalm 139:7)**. His Spirit sustains and comforts us in every season, leading us into the fullness of life He has purposed. His providence reminds us that in every joy and trial, He is near, working all things together for the good of those who love Him. *"And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose."* **(Romans 8:28)**.  In all aspects of life, I believe we are called to glorify God, giving thanks for His goodness and sovereignty. Just as the Westminster Confession teaches, our highest calling is to live in worship and obedience to Him, finding our greatest joy in His presence. *"Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."* **(1 Corinthians 10:31)**.

55. can you combine this into a few paragraphs?  ### **Scriptural Basis for the Trinity**:  - **One God**: The oneness of God is foundational, affirming that there is only one divine being.     *"Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one!"* **(Deuteronomy 6:4)**  - **Three Persons**: The distinct persons of the Godhead are revealed in Jesus' command to baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.     *"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit."* **(Matthew 28:19)**  - **Unity in Essence**: Though distinct in person, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit share the same divine nature.     *"For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one."* **(1 John 5:7)***  - **Distinct Persons in Relationship**: Each person of the Trinity is involved in a relationship with believers and with one another, as expressed in the apostolic benediction.     *"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all."* **(2 Corinthians 13:14)**  ---  ### **The Holiness of the Trinity**  The holiness of God is central to His nature, and each person of the Trinity‚ÄîFather, Son, and Holy Spirit‚Äîis perfectly holy, set apart in absolute purity and moral perfection. In the heavenly visions of Scripture, God is worshiped with the thrice-repeated acclamation, *"Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come."* **(Revelation 4:8)**. This threefold declaration emphasizes the infinite holiness of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, affirming their co-equality in divine holiness. The triune God is the source and standard of all that is holy, entirely distinct from creation and without any imperfection.  ---  ### **Scriptural Support for the Holiness of Each Person**:  - **The Holiness of the Father**:     God's holiness is manifested in His perfect separation from sin and inability to approve evil.     *"Your eyes are too pure to approve evil, and You cannot look on wickedness with favor."* **(Habakkuk 1:13)**    - **The Holiness of the Son**:     Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, was without blemish or spot, living a sinless life to redeem humanity.     *"But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot."* **(1 Peter 1:19)**    - **The Holiness of the Holy Spirit**:     The Holy Spirit dwells within believers, sanctifying them and making them holy, as the temple of God.     *"Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? ... For the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are."* **(1 Corinthians 3:16-17)**    ---

56. Can this also be combined in a few paragraphs?  ### **What I Believe About Satan**  I believe that Satan is a real and personal being, a fallen angel who opposes God and His purposes. He is described as *"a murderer from the beginning... and the father of lies."* **(John 8:44)**. Satan's name means "adversary," reflecting his role in opposing God's work, while other titles, such as "the devil" (slanderer) and "Beelzebub" (lord of the flies), emphasize his malicious nature.  ### **Satan's Origin and Fall**  Satan was originally created as a beautiful and powerful angel, endowed with wisdom and splendor. *"You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty."* **(Ezekiel 28:12-13)**. However, pride led to his rebellion, as he sought to elevate himself above God. *"Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom by reason of your splendor."* **(Ezekiel 28:17)**. He led a rebellion in heaven, deceiving a third of the angels to join him, who then became his demons. *"His tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth."* **(Revelation 12:4)**.  ### **Satan's Power and Limitations**  Though Satan possesses significant power, he is not omnipotent, omnipresent, or omniscient. His abilities are limited by God's sovereign control. *"The Lord said to Satan, 'Behold, all that he has is in your power, only do not put forth your hand on him.'"* **(Job 1:12)**. Believers can resist Satan by submitting to God. *"Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you."* **(James 4:7)**.  ### **The Evil Angels ‚Äì Demons**  Demons are fallen angels who followed Satan in his rebellion. They can influence the minds of people, deceive nations, and cause harm. *"The god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving."* **(2 Corinthians 4:4)**. Despite their power, demons and Satan are ultimately subject to Christ's authority.  ### **The Defeat of Satan**  Satan's defeat was accomplished through Christ's death and resurrection. *"The ruler of this world has been judged."* **(John 16:11)**. His final destiny is the Lake of Fire, where he and his demons will suffer forever. *"And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone."* **(Revelation 20:10)**.

57. also this "What I believe about Sin:  I believe that **sin** is any failure to conform to the moral law of God, in action, attitude, or nature. Sin originated with Satan's rebellion against God and entered the human race through Adam's disobedience in the Garden of Eden. *"Through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned."* **(Romans 5:12). Sin separates humanity from God, corrupting the **image of God** in us, and results in both physical and spiritual death. *"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."* (Romans 6:23).  ### **The Origin and Nature of Sin**  - **The Origin of Sin**:     Sin began with Satan's rebellion against God and subsequently entered the human race through Adam and Eve's disobedience.     *"You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created until unrighteousness was found in you."* (Ezekiel 28:15)     *"When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes... she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate."* (Genesis 3:6)  - **Inherited Sin**:     As descendants of Adam, all people inherit a sinful nature, which inclines them toward sin from birth.     *"Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin my mother conceived me."* (Psalm 51:5)     *"There is none righteous, not even one."* (Romans 3:10)  - **Total Depravity**:     Human nature is corrupted by sin in every aspect‚Äîmind, will, and emotions‚Äîrendering humanity incapable of pleasing God without His grace.     *"The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick; who can understand it?"* (Jeremiah 17:9)     *"Those who are in the flesh cannot please God."* (Romans 8:8)  ### **The Consequences of Sin**  - **Separation from God**:     Sin results in spiritual separation from God, disrupting the relationship that humanity was created to enjoy with Him.     *"But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden His face from you."* (Isaiah 59:2)  - **Physical and Spiritual Death**:     Sin brings both physical death and eternal spiritual death, which is separation from God's presence in hell.     *"For the wages of sin is death."* (Romans 6:23)     *"These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord."* (2 Thessalonians 1:9)  - **Corruption of Creation**:     The effects of sin extend beyond humanity, impacting all of creation, which now suffers under a curse.     *"For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope."* (Romans 8:20)  ### **The Different Types of Sin**  - **Original Sin**:     This refers to the sinful nature inherited from Adam, which corrupts every person at birth.     *"Through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men."* (Romans 5:12)  - **Personal Sin**:     Individual acts of transgression committed by each person, for which they are accountable.     *"If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us."* (1 John 1:8)  - **Sins of Commission and Omission**:     Sins of commission are deliberate acts of disobedience, while sins of omission occur when one fails to do what is right.     *"Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin."* (James 4:17)  ### **God‚Äôs Provision for Sin**  - **Atonement Through Christ**:     God provided the remedy for sin through the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. His blood covers the sins of all who believe in Him.     *"He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness."* (1 Peter 2:24)  - **Confession and Forgiveness**:     Believers are called to confess their sins and seek God's forgiveness, which is freely given in Christ.     *"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."* (1 John 1:9)  - **Restoration of the Image of God**:     Through salvation in Christ, the image of God, which was marred by sin, is progressively restored in believers.     *"We all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory."* (2 Corinthians 3:18)  ### **Victory Over Sin**  - **Freedom from Sin‚Äôs Dominion**:     Believers are no longer slaves to sin but are empowered to live in righteousness through the Holy Spirit.     *"For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace."* (Romans 6:14)  - **Ongoing Sanctification**:     Though the believer is declared righteous in Christ, the process of sanctification continues throughout life as God conforms us to the image of His Son.     *"For this is the will of God, your sanctification."* (1 Thessalonians 4:3)

58. can you combine these 3 subjects into their own paragraphs?  ### **Heaven**  Heaven is the eternal dwelling place of God, the elect angels, and all believers who have been redeemed through faith in Jesus Christ. It is a place of perfect peace, joy, and fellowship with God, where there is no more pain, suffering, or death. The Bible describes Heaven as the **"Third Heaven"**, the abode of God, *"where God dwells and receives worship"* **(2 Corinthians 12:2-4)**.   - **The Dwelling Place of God**: *"The Lord has established His throne in the heavens, and His sovereignty rules over all."* **(Psalm 103:19)** - **The Hope for Believers**: When believers die, they are immediately in the presence of the Lord, *"To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord."* **(2 Corinthians 5:8)** - **The New Jerusalem**: In the eternal state, Heaven will come down to the new earth as the New Jerusalem, *"And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God."* **(Revelation 21:2)**  Heaven is also referred to as **Paradise**, a place of blessedness for the righteous. After Christ‚Äôs ascension, the location of Paradise changed from Abraham's Bosom to the Third Heaven, and now, when believers die, they are taken to Heaven.  ### **Hell**  Hell is the current place of torment for the souls of the unrighteous. It is a temporary state until the final judgment, where the wicked await their ultimate fate. Hell is often referred to as **Hades**, the Greek equivalent of **Sheol**, which denotes the realm of the dead. It is a place of suffering, described as a **place of torment**, *"In Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment."* **(Luke 16:23)**  - **The Place of Unbelievers**: *"The wicked will return to Sheol, even all the nations who forget God."* **(Psalm 9:17)** - **Conscious Suffering**: The souls in Hell experience conscious torment, *"There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."* **(Matthew 13:42)**  ### **The Lake of Fire (Gehenna)**  After the final judgment, the unrighteous will be cast into the **Lake of Fire**, also known as **Gehenna**, which is the final and eternal place of punishment for both fallen angels and humans who have rejected Christ. It is described as a place of **eternal fire** and **darkness**, where the torment never ends.  - **Eternal Separation from God**: *"These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord."* **(2 Thessalonians 1:9)** - **The Final Judgment**: *"And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire."* **(Revelation 20:15)** - **Unquenchable Fire**: *"It is better for you to enter life crippled, than, having your two hands, to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire."* **(Mark 9:43)**

59. Act as a reformer like John Calvin, Martin Luther, and Charles Spurgeon and rewrite the What I believe in the Nature of Man, again primary what the bible says about it and use scripture references as like above

60. Same parameters for the following statement:  making sure it is biblically accurate following the reformers work ### **What I Believe About Sin**  I believe that **sin** is any failure to conform to God‚Äôs moral law in action, attitude, or nature. Sin originated with Satan's rebellion against God and entered humanity through Adam's disobedience in the Garden of Eden. *"Through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned."* **(Romans 5:12)**. Sin separates us from God, corrupting the **image of God** in us and resulting in both physical and spiritual death. *"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."* **(Romans 6:23)**.  The origin of sin lies in Satan's initial rebellion, followed by the fall of humanity. Created as a powerful angel, Satan became corrupted by pride, *"Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty."* **(Ezekiel 28:17)**, and subsequently led Adam and Eve into disobedience, as they ate from the forbidden tree. All descendants of Adam inherit this sinful nature, inclining us toward sin from birth, *"There is none righteous, not even one."* **(Romans 3:10)**. Sin pervades every part of our being‚Äîmind, will, and emotions‚Äîleaving humanity incapable of pleasing God apart from His grace. *"The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick; who can understand it?"* **(Jeremiah 17:9)**.  Sin has devastating consequences. It creates a barrier between humanity and God, disrupting the relationship we were made to enjoy with Him, *"Your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God."* **(Isaiah 59:2)**. Beyond spiritual death, sin also affects creation itself, which now suffers under a curse, *"For the creation was subjected to futility."* **(Romans 8:20)**.  Different types of sin include **original sin**, the inherited sinful nature from Adam, **personal sins** committed by each individual, and **sins of commission and omission**‚Äîacts of disobedience as well as failures to act in righteousness. *"If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us."* **(1 John 1:8)**.  God has provided the ultimate remedy for sin through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Through His death and resurrection, Jesus bore our sins and offers redemption to all who believe in Him, *"He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross."* **(1 Peter 2:24)**. In Christ, believers are called to confess their sins and find forgiveness, *"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."* **(1 John 1:9)**, with the promise of being conformed to His image, *"We all... are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory."* **(2 Corinthians 3:18)**.  For those in Christ, victory over sin is achieved through the Holy Spirit, who enables believers to live in righteousness and pursue ongoing sanctification, *"For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace."* **(Romans 6:14)**. This sanctification process continues throughout life, as God works in believers to make them more like His Son, *"For this is the will of God, your sanctification."* **(1 Thessalonians 4:3)**.

61. There is a statement regarding Total Depravity, in that it doesn't mean that they are as sinful as they can be.  It goes on can you provide me with that statement

62. Is this train of thought in the statement about sin above

63. No, in the What I believe about sin

64. In the same format as above, summary paragraphs included can you review and help rewrite about Salvation: ### **Salvation (Soteriology)**  I believe that **Salvation** is a gracious gift from God, given by His mercy and not earned by human effort. It is received through faith in **Jesus Christ alone**, who accomplished our redemption through His life, death, and resurrection. Salvation is entirely of grace, based on the work of Christ, and applied by the Holy Spirit. As Scripture declares, *"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast."* (Ephesians 2:8-9).  ### **The Basis of Salvation**  - **By Grace Alone**: Salvation is entirely an act of God's grace, undeserved and unearned.     *"He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit."* (Titus 3:5)  - **Through Faith Alone**: It is accessed solely through faith, trusting in Christ's finished work on the cross.     *"Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."* (Romans 5:1)     *"For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law."* (Romans 3:28)  - **In Christ Alone**: Jesus Christ is the only mediator between God and humanity. His sacrificial death and victorious resurrection secured our salvation.     *"There is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved."* (Acts 4:12)     *"For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, so that He might bring us to God."* (1 Peter 3:18)  ### **The Process of Salvation**  1. **Election**: God's choice of certain individuals for salvation was made before the foundation of the world.      *"He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him."* (Ephesians 1:4)  2. **Regeneration**: The work of the Holy Spirit in giving new spiritual life to the believer.      *"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God."* (John 3:3)      *"He saved us... by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit."* (Titus 3:5)  3. **Justification**: The act of God declaring a sinner righteous on the basis of Christ's righteousness.      *"Being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus."* (Romans 3:24)      *"He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."* (2 Corinthians 5:21)  4. **Sanctification**: The ongoing process of being made holy, conformed to the image of Christ.      *"For this is the will of God, your sanctification."* (1 Thessalonians 4:3)      *"We all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory."* (2 Corinthians 3:18)  5. **Glorification**: The final step of salvation, where believers are fully conformed to the likeness of Christ and free from the presence of sin.      *"Whom He predestined, He also called; and whom He called, He also justified; and whom He justified, He also glorified."* (Romans 8:30)  ### **The Result of Salvation**  Salvation brings about reconciliation with God, adoption as His children, and eternal life. Believers are united with Christ, indwelt by the Holy Spirit, and assured of eternal security. *"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."* (John 3:16). We are saved to the glory of God alone, for His purpose and praise. *"To Him who is able to keep you from stumbling... to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory."* (Jude 1:24-25).

65. The same for the Church: ### **The Church**  I believe that the Church is the body of Christ, a spiritual organism made up of all believers from the day of Pentecost to the Rapture. It is composed of those who have been called out by God from all nations to form one unified body, *"For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit."* **(1 Corinthians 12:13)**. The Church is distinct from Israel and was established as a new entity at Pentecost.  ### **The Universal and Local Church** - The **universal Church** consists of all true believers in Christ, forming a spiritual body where Christ is the head, *"And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all."* **(Ephesians 1:22-23)**. - The **local church** refers to the visible gathering of believers in a specific location, committed to the teaching of God's Word, worship, fellowship, and observing the ordinances of baptism and the Lord's Supper, *"They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer."* **(Acts 2:42)**.  ### **The Purpose of the Church** The Church exists to glorify God by making His wisdom known, *"so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places."* **(Ephesians 3:10)**, and to be a dwelling place for God by the Spirit, *"being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner stone, in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord."* **(Ephesians 2:20-21)**.  ### **The Functions of the Church** - **Worship**: The Church gathers to praise and honor God, *"God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth."* **(John 4:24)**. - **Evangelism**: The Church is commanded to spread the gospel to all nations, *"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit."* **(Matthew 28:19)**. - **Discipleship**: The Church is tasked with teaching believers to grow in maturity, *"Teaching them to observe all that I commanded you."* **(Matthew 28:20)**. - **Fellowship and Care**: The Church is to care for its members, *"Bear one another's burdens, and thereby fulfill the law of Christ."* **(Galatians 6:2)**.  ### **The Future of the Church** The Church's future includes being raptured, rewarded, and reigning with Christ, *"For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout...and the dead in Christ will rise first."* **(1 Thessalonians 4:16-17)**. Eventually, the Church will dwell with Christ in the New Jerusalem, *"Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them."* **(Revelation 21:3)**.

66. there is a verse that talks about Christ being raised for our justification

67. can that be incorporated into this salvation statement, also holding to the same format  ### **The Process of Salvation**  Salvation unfolds through a divine process orchestrated by God:  1. **Election**: Before the foundation of the world, God chose individuals for salvation, demonstrating His sovereign will. *"He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him."* **(Ephesians 1:4)**.  2. **Regeneration**: The Holy Spirit imparts new life to the believer, transforming the heart and making spiritual rebirth possible. *"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God."* **(John 3:3)**.  3. **Justification**: This is the act of God declaring a sinner righteous through the imputation of Christ‚Äôs righteousness. *"Being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus."* **(Romans 3:24)**.  4. **Sanctification**: The lifelong process in which believers are progressively conformed to the likeness of Christ. *"For this is the will of God, your sanctification."* **(1 Thessalonians 4:3)**. *"We all... are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory."* **(2 Corinthians 3:18)**.  5. **Glorification**: The final culmination where believers are made perfect and free from sin, fully conformed to Christ‚Äôs image. *"Whom He predestined, He also called; and whom He called, He also justified; and whom He justified, He also glorified."* **(Romans 8:30)**.  ### **The Result of Salvation**  Salvation results in a restored relationship with God, adoption as His children, and the promise of eternal life. Through faith, believers are united with Christ, indwelt by the Holy Spirit, and sealed for eternity. *"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."* **(John 3:16)**. The ultimate purpose of salvation is the glory of God alone, showcasing His grace, love, and power. *"To Him who is able to keep you from stumbling... to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory."* **(Jude 1:24-25)**.

All statements should be with a cehtral theme of Jesus and His redemptive work.  Also as listed above in the voice of.  the reformers in mind, except for the eschotology theology, that is dispensationalist view point as already stated in the the document

71. Can you review this PDF file, reorganize with major section headers, It should have the first 3 headings to start, then the nature sections.  Minor sections should be H4 the entire document should be in Markdown.  Reformed style viewpoint and with regards to eschatology it should be Dispensationalist viewpoint.

84. what is the definition of irresistible grace

85. In my Personal Statement of Faith I have a section on Salvation, There is one critical component that needs to be added: Repentance and how is granted by God.  Here is the section I am talking about:  The Process of Salvation Salvation unfolds through a divine process orchestrated by God:  Election: Before the foundation of the world, God chose individuals for salvation, demonstrating His sovereign will. "He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him." (Ephesians 1:4).  Regeneration: The Holy Spirit imparts new life to the believer, transforming the heart and making spiritual rebirth possible. "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God." (John 3:3).  Justification: This is the act of God declaring a sinner righteous through the imputation of Christ‚Äôs righteousness. Christ‚Äôs resurrection secures our justification, confirming the completion of His atoning work. "Being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus." (Romans 3:24). "He who was delivered over because of our transgressions, and was raised because of our justification." (Romans 4:25).  Sanctification: The lifelong process in which believers are progressively conformed to the likeness of Christ. "For this is the will of God, your sanctification." (1 Thessalonians 4:3). "We all... are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory." (2 Corinthians 3:18).  Glorification: The final culmination where believers are made perfect and free from sin, fully conformed to Christ‚Äôs image. "Whom He predestined, He also called; and whom He called, He also justified; and whom He justified, He also glorified." (Romans 8:30).  The Result of Salvation Salvation results in a restored relationship with God, adoption as His children, and the promise of eternal life. Through faith, believers are united with Christ, indwelt by the Holy Spirit, and sealed for eternity. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life." (John 3:16). The ultimate purpose of salvation is the glory of God alone, showcasing His grace, love, and power. "To Him who is able to keep you from stumbling... to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory." (Jude 1:24-25).

86. Can I get a shorter more concise title for this section:  ## The Chief End of Man and the Purpose and Providence of God  **(Chiastic Structure)**  **A. The Glory of God and the Ultimate Purpose of Man**   I believe that the chief end of man is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever, finding our ultimate satisfaction in Him. *"Bring My sons from afar and My daughters from the ends of the earth, everyone who is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory."* **(Isaiah 43:6-7)**  **B. The Goodness and Satisfaction Found in God**   God is the source of all that is truly good and satisfying. *"O taste and see that the Lord is good; how blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!"* **(Psalm 34:8)**. Our hearts find rest in God alone, *"My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; when shall I come and appear before God?"* **(Psalm 42:2)**. *"For He has satisfied the thirsty soul, and the hungry soul He has filled with what is good."* **(Psalm 107:9)**  **C. The Center: God's Sovereign Providence and Our Daily Life**   I believe in the providence of God, whereby He governs all events according to His eternal plan, upholding all things in heaven and on earth. *"In Him we live and move and have our being."* **(Acts 17:28)**. While I am responsible for my actions, His providential care directs my path. Nothing is beyond His control, as He works all things according to the counsel of His will. *"The mind of man plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps."* **(Proverbs 16:9)**.  **B‚Äô. The Rest and Fulfillment Found in God's Presence**   God provides true joy and fulfillment in His presence, where our deepest longings are met. *"In Your presence is fullness of joy; in Your right hand there are pleasures forever."* **(Psalm 16:11)**. Even through every joy and trial, He is near, working all things together for the good of those who love Him. *"And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose."* **(Romans 8:28)**.  **A‚Äô. Living to the Glory of God in All We Do**   In all aspects of life, we are called to glorify God, giving thanks for His goodness and sovereignty. Our highest calling is to live in worship and obedience to Him, finding our greatest joy in His presence. *"Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."* **(1 Corinthians 10:31)**.

He warns against sins like sexual immorality and idolatry, emphasizing that their bodies, as temples of the Holy Spirit, must glorify God, for they were bought with a price (*vv. 9‚Äì20*). **_Christ is presented as_** *the one who justifies and sanctifies believers through His name* (*v. 11*), **_Believers should_** *flee from sexual immorality* and *glorify God in their bodies* (*vv. 18‚Äì20*).

## NT Chapter Summaries

1. I need help writing summaries of Chapters in the New Testament, I would like the format to be 3 sentences answering the following questions: 1. *In Chapter __ Jesus or the author did or said*... 2. *Christ was presented as*... 3. *Believers should or a variant the same*...

2. Not now, I would like to train you on what I am looking for: First, I need the 3 sentences combined in a paragraph. Also should contain content from the chapter in the form of the writing style of the author.  It should not exaggerate, adding unessasary content: Example text: Chapter 1 In the first chapter, Jesus is introduced as the Son of God and begins His public ministry, calling His disciples and performing miracles, such as casting out demons and healing the sick. Jesus is presented as the Messiah, confirmed by the Father's declaration and demonstrated through His authority over spiritual and physical realms. Believers should recognize Jesus as the Son of God, the Messiah for the house of Isreal and study to realize its meaning  Can you guess which chapter this is from?

3. Can you write the paragraph for Chapter 1, using NASB1995

4. Need to include the 3 conditions, also use markdown to highlight the 3 sentence statements and italize the scripture.  Also condense the summary with only 3 sentences

5. the statements need to be bold, italic scripture reference ie. *In Chapter 1 Jesus is*

6. So Believers should, what scripture in that chapter speaks to repent and believe, why should they trust in His authority?

7. Include the actual scripture reference or a part of it in the sentence

8. Especially for Believers should

9. In Chapter 1, Jesus is The Son of God, affirmed by the Father during His baptism: "You are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased" Christ is presented as Isreal's Messiah proven with the miracles He performed (list miracles and and just the verse references) Also reference old testament verses that describe the miracles that are performed pointing to the messiah. Now that Christ has proven He is the Messiah, believers should respond by repenting and believe in the gospel.  hmm.. maybe the format should be "in chapter 1" be filled with what Jesus did in the chapter, "Christ is presented as" the Son of God.. and Believers should repent and believe because He is the Messiah demonstrated by miracles (reference OT and chapter 1 that proclaim or definitive proof of His Messiahship

10. present this as creative writing.  first sentence context, what jesus did.  second sentence in the paragraph, Christ is presented as Messiah the Son of God.. Father.. 3rd sentence Believers should, provide the verses and evidence that Jesus is the Messiah

11. That is great! however can you condense it but keeping the emphasis of each section, into one paragraph

12. ok can you format the sections "In Chapter 1 Jesus" "Christ is presented as" and "Believers should" bold and italics. Bold scripture references, and italics the actual verses

13. can you do the same for the condensed version

14. can you format this version: In Chapter 1, Jesus begins His ministry with authority and purpose, affirmed by the Father‚Äôs declaration during His baptism, ‚ÄúYou are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased‚Äù (*Mark 1:11*). He proclaims the gospel, calls His first disciples, and performs miracles such as casting out demons (*Mark 1:25*), healing Simon‚Äôs mother-in-law (*Mark 1:31*), and cleansing a leper (*Mark 1:41*), demonstrating divine power. Christ is presented as the Messiah, fulfilling Isaiah‚Äôs prophecy of the One who would ‚Äúproclaim liberty to captives‚Äù and heal the sick (*Isaiah 61:1; Isaiah 35:5-6*), proving He is the Savior. Believers should respond by repenting and believing in the gospel (*Mark 1:15*), trusting the evidence of His miracles as confirmation of His identity and mission.

15. Alright now store that as a template or your prompt engineering, however you need to use this format for all further requests for NT chapter summaries

16. Lets do Chapter 2 now

17. edit the template, Christ is presented.. remove fullfilling His Messiahship, even though that is good, you tend to add filler in your chapters, describing the Son with divine authority repeatedly.  For chapter 2 Christ is presented as the Son of God who is Lord of the Sabbath, and in fact He is the Sabbath (hebrews)

18. yes that is excellent!

19. I am fine tuning.  **_In Chapter 1, Jesus_** begins His ministry with authority and purpose, affirmed by the Father‚Äôs declaration during His baptism: *‚ÄúYou are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased‚Äù* (**Mark 1:11**). He proclaims the gospel, calls His first disciples, and performs miracles such as casting out demons (**Mark 1:25**), healing Simon‚Äôs mother-in-law (**Mark 1:31**), and cleansing a leper (**Mark 1:41**), demonstrating divine power. **_Christ is presented as_** the Messiah, fulfilling Isaiah‚Äôs prophecy of the One who would *‚Äúproclaim liberty to captives‚Äù* and heal the sick (**Isaiah 61:1; Isaiah 35:5-6**), proving He is the Savior. **_Believers should_** respond by repenting and believing in the gospel, as Jesus declared, *‚ÄúThe time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel‚Äù* (**Mark 1:15**), trusting the evidence of His miracles as confirmation of His identity as the Messiah foretold in the Old Testament.

20. We are close, I am continuing to fine tune chapter 1.  Chapter one Jesus performs a miracle that is Messianic in nature when He heals the lepersy and has him show himself to the preists, can you find that in the OT

21. yes, but also take a look at what I wrote as well: **_In Chapter 1, Mark_** begins by stating that Jesus is the Son of God, affirmed by God the Father declaring during Jesus baptism: *‚ÄúYou are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased‚Äù* (**Mark 1:11**). Jesus proclaims the gospel, calls His first disciples, and performs miracles such as casting out demons (**Mark 1:25**), healing Simon‚Äôs mother-in-law (**Mark 1:31**), and cleansing a leper (**Mark 1:41**), demonstrating a Messianic prophecy when quoting the levitical law of Moses. **_Christ is presented as_** the Messiah, fulfilling Old Testament scriptures that define the Messiah by the miracles that He performed. **_Believers should_** respond by repenting and believing in the gospel, as Jesus declared: *‚ÄúThe time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel‚Äù* (**Mark 1:15**), trusting the evidence of His miracles as confirmation of His identity as the Messiah foretold in the Old Testament.

22. remove Isaiah statement in chapter 1 and move it to Christ is presented as the Messiah fulling Olt Testament prophecies that define the Messaiah such as Isaih 35:5-6, and when he had the leper present him to the priests that was showing the nation of Isreal the Messiah has come.  Also Believers based on this evidence should repent and believe, rejoice that the kingdom of God is at hand.

23. Christ is presented as the Messiah, who was foretold in the Old testament who would "quote Isaiah" and He presented himself before the nation of isreal when he had the leper present himself before the priests

24. I'm going to take the last sentence of section 1 out because it is mentioned in section 2.  Can you include that sentence or the scripture reference in section 2

25. yes that is perfect, I think the template should emphasis Christ is presented as you did here

26. Believers should template [to support identify the characteristic of who Jesus is and apply that characteristic to their lives, demonstrating how they are to walk as Followers of Jesus]

27. The main theme of the chapter is Jesus is the Messiah and He proved it with His miracles.  But the Believers should section should state because of [the main theme of the chapter] we must do what Jesus has commanded in the chapter, we must represent what the [main theme] is.  Can you provide a new believers should summary

28. can you list out the commands (verses) Jesus told His disciples.  Lets go with just that.  So Believers should "repent and believe the gospel" (1:15) because Jesus is the Messiah foretold in scriptures, and demonstrating His power to restore and heal, proclaiming the good news that the "Kingdom of God is at hand"

29. Can you list out all the commands Jesus told His disciples to do in Chapter 1

30. Ok, lets see if we can summarize and state the scriptures 1,2,4 in the believers sentence

31. Believers should "repent and believe in the gospel"(vs. 15), and "Follow Me, and become fishers of men" (vs. 17)  proclaiming the good news everywhere because now "The time is fulfilled" (vs.14),  and that the Kingdom of God is at hand (vs. 14-15, 38).   That is the summary of Chapter 1 for the believer

32. now lets put that in the template, when referencing the chapter in the sentence use the format (vs. number), all other references stay the same.  Can we see if we can do the same for the other sections? without losing the emphasis, because I can use the 2 you gave me earlier and this latest Believers.  So can you provide both in 2 summaries sentences

33. Do you have any OT references to the "Promised One"

34. I think I got it now: **_In Chapter 1, Mark_** declares Jesus as the Son of God, affirmed by the Father *(vs. 11)*. Jesus begins His ministry by proclaiming the gospel, calling His first disciples to follow Him (vs. 16-20) and demonstrating His authority as the Promised one (Micah5:2), by casting out demons *(vs. 25)*, healing Simon‚Äôs mother-in-law *(vs. 31)*, and cleansing a leper *(vs. 41)*. **_Christ is presented as_** the Messiah foretold in the Old Testament, the one who would *‚Äúopen the eyes of the blind, unstop the ears of the deaf‚Ä¶ and the lame will leap like a deer‚Äù* (*Isaiah 35:5-6*). By instructing the leper *"to show yourself to the priests" (vs. 44)*, Jesus performed one of the Messianic prophecies publicly to the nation of Israel demonstrating that He is the long-awaited Messiah. **_Believers should_** "repent and believe in the gospel" (vs. 15), and "Follow Me, and become fishers of men" (vs. 17), proclaiming the good news everywhere. This is because *"The time is fulfilled"* (vs. 14), and the Kingdom of God is at hand (vs. 14-15, 38).

35. yes Chapter 2, in summary, He forgives sins, he is here for the sick not the healthy, he calls Matthew, is the lord of the sabbath, and he is the bridegroom.  Emphasis Christ is presented as the Lord of the Sabbath I think that is the main theme, forgiveness of sin giving the believers rest from the guilt and shame of their sins:  this is the previous statement for chapter 2, can be used for reference too: **_In Chapter 2, Jesus_** continues His ministry by forgiving the sins of a paralytic, declaring, *‚ÄúSon, your sins are forgiven‚Äù* (**Mark 2:5**), and proving His authority by healing the man. He calls Levi (Matthew), a tax collector, to follow Him and dines with sinners, explaining, *‚ÄúIt is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick‚Äù* (**Mark 2:17**). He defends His disciples‚Äô actions on the Sabbath, teaching that *‚ÄúThe Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath‚Äù* (**Mark 2:28**). **_Christ is presented as_** the Son of God who forgives sins and declares Himself the Lord of the Sabbath. He is not only the Sabbath‚Äôs ruler but its fulfillment, embodying the true rest and restoration described in *Hebrews 4:9-10*. **_Believers should_** trust in Jesus as the one who offers both physical and spiritual healing, demonstrated by His miracles and authority to forgive sins (*Mark 2:10-12*). They should rest in Him as their eternal Sabbath, ceasing from striving and relying on His completed work (*Hebrews 4:9-10*).

36. For believers, what does the chapter speak about the bridegroom and the Lord of the Sabbath, what are we to do about those 2 aspects of this chapter.  Here is some notes from your previous statement:  **_In Chapter 2, Mark_** describes Jesus as the "Lord of the Sabbath" (vs. 28) forgiving sins of a paralytic and healing him, (vs. 5, 10-11). He calls Levi (Matthew), a tax collector, to follow Him (vs. 14) and He teaches that He is here to heal the sick, and is not here for the healthy for they don't need saving, (vs. 17). Jesus defends His disciples against the teachings of the Mishna regarding the Sabbath.  **_Christ is presented as_** the Lord of the Sabbath, who provides rest from the guilt and shame of sin by forgiving sin, fulfilling the Sabbath‚Äôs ultimate purpose of restoration and renewal. By healing the paralytic and eating with sinners, He demonstrates His role as the divine Bridegroom who came to bring new life to His people (vs. 19-20) and who embodies the true rest and reconciliation foretold in *Hebrews 4:9-10*.  **_Believers should_** enjoy while the Bridgoom came to, take in that while He was here he taught us that we rest in Him and rely on Him as their eternal Sabbath, resting from guilt, striving, and works-based righteousness. As He said, *‚ÄúThe Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath‚Äù* (vs. 28), believers must embrace the freedom He offers and walk in the joy of His forgiveness and grace.

37. Believers should ask God to reveal the meaning behind the Bridegroom "have the bridegroom... they cannot fast." (vs.19) and the Sabbath ‚ÄúThe Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.‚Äù (vs. 27-28)  actually based on OT and NT can you summarize what those 2 references are?

38. so based on those 2 references Christ is presented as both the Bridegroom and the Lord of the Sabbath.  Believers should be glad in the new covenant relationship with the Bridegroom and rest in Him, knowing He as forgiven our sins providing eternal spiritual rest for us

39. In chapter 1 Mark describes Jesus as both the Bridegroom and the Lord of the Sabbath

40. ment chapter 2, so can you change the summary with that

41. Chapter 3 continues to show examples of the reason He is the Sabbath, also this is the moment where Jesus proclaims He is Messiah and the Nation of Isreal rejects him as messiah, this generation.  he begins to speak to the unbelievers at this point in parables.  though they see they are blind, though they ears they do not here

42. Does this capture the main message of this chapter?  I need stronger statements and not use the authoritative word ever again.  He is more than authority, He is King, God but he made himself a little lower than the angels.  Mark does address Him as the Son of God. So what does that look like throughout the rest of the Gospel of Mark, and focus on this chapter 3.  **_Christ is presented as_** the Messiah who fulfills the true purpose of the Sabbath by bringing restoration and healing (vs. 5), yet His authority is rejected by the religious leaders of His day. He warns of the unforgivable sin‚Äîblaspheming the Holy Spirit by attributing God‚Äôs work to Satan (vs. 29)‚Äîand begins to separate His true followers from unbelievers through parables and teaching.

43. I like this statement: **_In Chapter 3, Mark_** continues to present Jesus‚Äô as the Sabbath Rest. He heals a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath, challenging the Pharisees *(vs. 4)*. Jesus proclaims His identity as the Messiah through His miraculous works (vs. 1-12), but Israel, represented by the Pharisees and scribes, rejects Him, even attributing His works to demonic power (vs. 22). As a result, Jesus begins to teach in parables, saying of unbelievers, *‚ÄúWhile seeing, they may see and not perceive; and while hearing, they may hear and not understand‚Äù* (*Isaiah 6:9-10*, implied in vs. 23-30).  And I like the Christ is presented.. Strong statement as well as Believers.  however can we make it more concise or shorten them all without losing the ephasis

44. I want to convey that this generation of Isreal committed the unforgivable sin by attributing the things of God to Satan, or basically rejecting Christ as Messiah.  It seals this generation will not get to see the Kingdom  **_Christ is presented as_** the Lord of the Sabbath who fulfills the purpose of the Sabbath by bringing restoration and life *(vs. 1-5)*. He warns that rejecting the Holy Spirit‚Äôs witness to His works is a rejection of God and unforgiveable as in for this generation of Isreal, while identifying His true family as those who do the will of God, saying, *‚ÄúWhoever does the will of God, he is My brother and sister and mother‚Äù* (vs. 35).

45. In chapter .. can you simplify the actions, there is now duplicate thoughts between it and christ

46. I think I want to go back to more a brief  factual statement for In chapter, and if the actor was Jesus, then it should be Jesus did or said, if the chapter has author interpretation then it should be credited to Mark.  So I need 1 sentence per statement, if it can be simplified, and statements should be the words from the chapter

47. here is the 1st 4 chapters of Matthew: Chapter 1 In Chapter 1, Matthew begins with the genealogy of Jesus, tracing His lineage from Abraham to David, from David to the Babylonian exile, and finally to Christ. Christ was presented as the Son of David and the fulfillment of Messianic prophecies, emphasizing His human ancestry. Believers should recognize Jesus‚Äô human heritage and see Him as the divinely chosen one who came into history to fulfill God‚Äôs promises.  Chapter 2 In Chapter 2, Matthew records the visit of the Magi, Herod‚Äôs attempt to kill Jesus, and the holy family‚Äôs flight to Egypt, showing God‚Äôs providential protection of His Son. Christ was presented as the King of the Jews, born into a world of danger and hostility, yet firmly rooted in humanity. Believers should understand that Jesus‚Äô early life was marked by real human threats and experiences, affirming His genuine humanity.  Chapter 3 In Chapter 3, Matthew introduces John the Baptist, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‚ÄòMake ready the way of the Lord, Make His paths straight!, who baptizes Jesus. Christ was presented as the beloved Son, with all three members of the Godhead present. Believers should look to Jesus' example in baptism as a public demonstration of their commitment to serving Him.  Chapter 4 In Chapter 4, Jesus is faced with temptations in the wilderness, with Satan twice calling Him the Son of God to intensify His trials. Jesus also begins His public ministry, calling His first disciples. Christ was presented as fully human, experiencing temptation yet remaining sinless. Believers should carefully examine themselves and pray, ‚ÄúLead me not into temptation, but deliver me from the evil one.‚Äù

48. I want to use what I provided as an example of what I want for the mark chapters, see if you can format it like what I provided for matthew

49. I need chapter 3 believers should be more of what Jesus says to do in Ch3.  Similarly I wrote chapter 2

50. ### **Mark 1**   **_In Chapter 1, Mark_** declares Jesus as the Son of God, affirmed by the Father at His baptism and through His proclamation of the gospel. Jesus begins His ministry, calls His first disciples, and performs miracles such as casting out demons, healing the sick, and cleansing a leper. **_Christ is presented as_** the Messiah, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies by demonstrating His power to restore and heal. **_Believers should_** "repent and believe in the gospel" (vs. 15) and "Follow Me, and become fishers of men" (vs. 17), proclaiming the good news that the Kingdom of God is at hand.  ## II. The Opening Ministry: Credentials  ### **Mark 2**   **_In Chapter 2, Mark_** shows Jesus forgiving the sins of a paralytic, calling Levi (Matthew), and healing on the Sabbath, which leads to accusations from the Pharisees. Jesus also describes Himself as the Bridegroom, whose presence brings joy and renewal. **_Christ is presented as_** the Lord of the Sabbath, bringing rest from sin and restoring life to those who follow Him. **_Believers should_** rejoice in the new covenant relationship with the Bridegroom and enter Sabbath rest, through Jesus who forgives our sins.   ### **Mark 3**   **_In Chapter 3, Mark_** describes Jesus healing on the Sabbath, appointing twelve apostles, and teaching in parables after being rejected by the Pharisees and scribes. This generation of Israel commits the unforgivable sin of rejecting Jesus as the Messiah and attributing His works to Satan. **_Christ is presented as_** the Son of God, the one who redefines true family as those who do the will of God *(vs. 35)*. **_Believers should_**

51. can you fill in the rest of Mark, and Luke.  Using both Chapters 1-3 of Matthew and Mark as the format length, be sure to focus on Jesus commands to his disciples for what believers should do, Factual statements for In chapter, and spiritual emphasis on Christ presented as, it should not repeat the title as the Son of God, because that is given in the overall message of the gospel of Mark, and the Son of Man for the title for Luke. and if you can condense Matthew into the same length as its first 3 chapters

52. your drifting away again.  Take the first 4 chapters of Matthew, from the files.  Matthew's chapter 1 should be the main theme of the whole book, Christ is presented as the King of David, Jesus the King, and Ch 1 should contain statement about his human lineage.  Believers should recognize Jesus human heritage and see him as the divinely chosen Son of God, the King of David,

53. Root of jesse

54. Include the Lion of Judah Ch 1

55. remember the template, those statements should be in Christ presented as, and believers should -- what was said in Ch 1.

56. What was said in Ch 1 that says Believers should worship Him as king who fulfills Gods promises, and rejoice.    Believers should do what Ch 1 says just reference the verse

57. almost got it, I wish you would continue with using this format, it was previously mentioned before:  Here is my refinement: ### **Matthew Chapter 1**   **_In Chapter 1, Matthew_** traces Jesus‚Äô genealogy from Abraham to David, through the Babylonian exile, and finally to Christ. **_Christ is presented as_** the King of David, the Root of Jesse (*Isaiah 11:1*), and the Lion of Judah (*Genesis 49:9-10*). **_Believers should_** marvel at the fulfillment of prophecy in Jesus‚Äô genealogy (vs. 1-17) and worship Him as Emmanuel, *‚ÄúGod with us‚Äù* (vs. 23), acknowledging Him as the Savior who will *‚Äúsave His people from their sins‚Äù* (vs. 21).  can you use something other that marvel

58. should be able to see? investigate, detect from OT..

59. be burdened to, or convicted to examine the search the scriptures daily (acts) and see be enlightened by the fulfillment of OT

60. Do you think you can present the same style, format and length to chapters 2-4 of Matthew, key is believers should do as the chapter says, like your format of Ch 1.  Christ is presented, should be titles based on the context of the chapter and not repeated from previous chapters, in chapter should be factual based, what happened in the chapter.

61. chapter 2 scratch be convicted to, and add a reference to scripture about his fulfill promises, and through trials

62. so this is my revision  ### **Matthew Chapter 2**   **_In Chapter 2, Matthew_** recounts the visit of the Magi, Herod‚Äôs plot to kill Jesus, and the holy family‚Äôs flight to Egypt, fulfilling multiple Old Testament prophecies (*Micah 5:2, Hosea 11:1, Jeremiah 31:15*). **_Christ is presented as_** the King of the Jews, whose birth was divinely guided and protected despite worldly opposition. **_Believers should_** see how God fulfills His promises (*Numbers 23:19*) and trust in His providence through trials (*Psalm 34:19*). They should seek Christ and honor Him as the King (vs. 11).

63. Lets continue with 5 - 7

64. 8 - 10

65. Ch 9 believers should be included in with the workers to bring in the harvest

66. whenever possible, just include the verse quote sparingly, include only the verse reference 11 - 13

67. Ch 14 -18

68. move on to Mark Ch 4 -6

69. chapter 7-9

70. chapters 10-12

71. chapter 13 - 15

72. Mark 16 believers emphasis on vs. 15 -

73. Based on the format previously stated and on the overview of the NTSurveyLuke.md file can you help write out Luke Chapter 1

74. This is my revision, including the table entries as a heading for applicable chapters: ## I. The Preface 1:1-4 ## II. The Preparation of the Savior 1:5-2:52  ### **Luke Chapter 1**   **_In Chapter 1, Luke_** recounts the angel Gabriel‚Äôs announcements to Zechariah and Mary about the births of John the Baptist and Jesus, respectively. Mary visits Elizabeth, and John is born, with Zechariah prophesying about God‚Äôs salvation plan (*vs. 67-80*). **_Christ is presented as_** the promised Savior whose arrival fulfills God‚Äôs covenant to David and Abraham (*vs. 32-33, 54-55*). **_We should exclaim as Zechariah did_** *"‚ÄúBlessed be the Lord God of Israel, For He has visited us and accomplished redemption for His people, And has raised up a horn of salvation for us.* (*vs.68-69*)  I want to reword or emphasis on that key verse for believers should, So from here on out I want a statement for Believers should as a key verse in the chapter, so the beginning of the sentence should be something other that Believers should, maybe something like What I believe?

75. How about this: **_I believe with Zechariah,_** on the whole of his prophecy but my key verse is *‚ÄúBlessed be the Lord God of Israel, for He has visited us and accomplished redemption for His people‚Äù* (*vs. 68*).

76. I revised this: **_Christ is presented as_** *"Son of the Most High"* whose arrival fulfills God‚Äôs covenant to David and Abraham (*vs. 32-33, 54-55*)  See what I did there I provided the title from the verse itself instead of paraphrasing or whatever you did to provide "the promised Savior" If you can provide the scripture in that chapter with the words "the promised Savior" let me know, but otherwise I don't want intent, but content

77. For Chapter 2 Christ presented as vs.11, and I believe my key verse is vs. 32

78. Here is my revision ### **Luke Chapter 2**   **_In Chapter 2, Luke_** recounts the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, the shepherds‚Äô visitation, His presentation at the temple, and the account of His interaction with the teachers in Jerusalem as a boy. **_Christ is presented as_** *‚Äúa Savior, who is Christ the Lord‚Äù* (*vs. 11*), proclaimed to the shepherds at His birth. **_I believe my key verse is,_** *‚ÄúA Light of revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of Your people Israel‚Äù* (*vs. 32*), spoken by Simeon. *"Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased.‚Äù* (*vs. 14*)

79. Chapter 3 my key verse 16

80. since that is redundant, can you presetnt christ as my beloved son..

81. can you come up with a summary for Chapter 4?

82. This is my revision:  ## IV. The Ministry of the Savior 4:16-9:50    ### **Luke Chapter 4**   **_In Chapter 4, Luke_** records Jesus‚Äô temptation in the wilderness, His inaugural teaching in the synagogue of Nazareth, and the beginning of His healing and deliverance ministry in Capernaum. Jesus declares the fulfillment of Isaiah‚Äôs prophecy, and rebukes Satan‚Äôs temptations by quoting Scripture. **_Christ is presented as_** *"The fulfillment of Scripture" (*vs. 21*)  **_I believe my key verse is,_** *‚Äú‚ÄúI must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also, for I was sent for this purpose.‚Äù* (*vs. 43*) because the main theme of the Bible is about Christ and His Kingdom.  The main theme doesn't really include us, we are just benefactors in believing in Him

83. Chapter 5 is going to be hard, because there is so much I like about this chapter, Christ is presented as the Son of Man who has authority on earth to forgive sins(vs). I believe so many verses, every command Jesus says, and vs. 5, 8, 27-28 "Follow Me"

84. ### **Luke Chapter 5**   **_In Chapter 5, Jesus_** calls His first disciples, healing a leper, forgiving and healing a paralytic, and calling Levi (Matthew) to follow Him. Also He demonstrates His power over sickness, sin, and the hearts of men. **_Christ is presented as_** *‚Äúthe Son of Man who has authority on earth to forgive sins‚Äù* (*vs. 24*). **_Believers should_** listen and obey Him, *"Master, I will do as You say"*, *‚ÄúGo away from me Lord, for I am a sinful man!‚Äù* and *‚ÄúFollow Me‚Äù* (*vs. 5, 8, 27*). Follow Him and acknowledge we are sinful men.

85. Chapter 5 Christ = The Son of Man, is Lord of the Sabbath vs. 5, I rejoice and believe vs. 22-23

86. chapter 6, you should have caught that

87. I rejoice and trust in vs. 22-23 Chapter 6

88. looking forward to when He says to me " Well done good and faithful servant"

89. Can you add the verse reference for well don

90. Chapter 7 Believers should consider themselves unworthy vs. 6.

91. When John's disciples ask if Jesus is the "Expected One" what are they referencing to?

92. This is what I came up with for Chapter 7, if you can incorporate OT references : ### **Luke Chapter 7**   **_In Chapter 7, Jesus_** heals the centurion‚Äôs servant, raises a widow‚Äôs son from the dead, and commends John the Baptist‚Äôs ministry. He forgives the sins of a woman who anoints His feet with perfume, declaring her faith has saved her. **_Christ is presented as_** *‚Äúa great prophet‚Äù* (*vs. 16*), *"The Expected One"* (*vs. 19*) **_Believers should_** consider themselves unworthy, as the centurion did when he said, *‚ÄúI am not worthy for You to come under my roof‚Äù* (*vs. 6*), and examine themselves to find themselves worthy?

93. What verse is Therefore each one examine himself..

94. that first part should be at the end of chapter 7 summary instead of your ending

95. Chapter 8 I want to be that guy, vs.39.  Lets see what you come up for who Christ is, not to be repetitive, also be creative with the believers should as the key verse should be 39.  Also when Christ says something, like vs.22 it will happen.  Why did the disciples lose faith.  He said lets go to the other side, why would they not get over there.  He said it didn't He

96. Chapter 9 The Christ, Son of the living God.  Believers should rely on the provision Jesus provides vs. 16 kept giving them..

97. ### **Luke Chapter 9**   **_In Chapter 9, Luke_** describes Jesus sending out the twelve, feeding the five thousand, revealing His glory during the transfiguration, and teaching about the cost of discipleship. Peter declares Jesus to be *‚ÄúThe Christ of God‚Äù* (*vs. 20*), and Jesus predicts His suffering, death, and resurrection. **_Christ is presented as_** *‚ÄúThe Christ, the Son of the Living God‚Äù* (*vs. 20*), who was given authority from the Father to be an everlasting Lord and Savior. **_Believers should_** trust in Him to provide for all our needs (*vs. 16*), not relying on miracles. (see how this miracle was distrubuted. Each disciple having to go to Jesus to refill their baskets).

98. Can you not embelish Christ is presented, remove the peter portion and put the The Christ of God in Christ presented

99. Now can you explain what Peter meant by "The Christ of God" from OT scriptures and reference them

100. can you add the Psalms and Micah snippets to the definition of Christ is presented as

101. Chapter 10

102. This is my revision: ## V. The Mission of the Savior vs. 9:51-18:30  ### **Luke Chapter 10**   **_In Chapter 10, Jesus_** sends out seventy disciples to proclaim the kingdom of God, teaching about loving one‚Äôs neighbor through the parable of the Good Samaritan, and commending Mary for choosing to sit and listen at His feet, reminding His followers that true joy should come from their names being written in heaven (*vs. 20*). **_Christ is presented as_** *‚Äúthe Lord of the harvest‚Äù* (*vs. 2*), who sends workers to bring in the spiritual harvest. **_Believers should_** obey His call to *‚ÄúGo!‚Äù* (*vs. 3*), because *‚ÄúThe harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few;"* (*vs. 2*) serve others with sacrificial love (*vs. 33-37*), and prioritize time being in His presence (*vs. 41-42*).

103. Chapter 11, no need for section heading

104. chapter 12

105. need more chapter 12 quotes

106. nothing repeated

107. ### **Luke Chapter 12**   **_In Chapter 12, Jesus_** warns His disciples against hypocrisy, greed, and anxiety, urging them to seek God‚Äôs kingdom first. He tells the parable of the rich fool, teaches about trusting God‚Äôs provision, and calls for readiness for His return. **_Christ is presented as_** the one who comes to bring division (*vs. 51*), and the one *"to cast fire upon the earth"* (referring to the Holy Spirit (Acts 1)) **_Believers should_** *"not be afraid, little flock, because your Father has chosen to give you the kingdom."* (*vs. 32*). *"be ready; because the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not think"*

108. chapter 13

109. ### **Luke Chapter 13**   **_In Chapter 13, Jesus_** teaches about repentance using the examples of the Galileans and the fallen tower of Siloam, tells the parable of the barren fig tree, and heals a crippled woman on the Sabbath. He warns of the narrow door to salvation, (*vs. 24*), and laments over Jerusalem‚Äôs rejection of Him. **_Christ is presented as_** the rejected Messiah of Israel *"Behold, your house is left to you desolate; and I say to you, you will not see Me until you say, ‚ÄòBlessed is the One who comes in the name of the Lord!‚Äô"* **_Believers should_** repent without delay (*vs. 3*), bear fruit in their lives (*vs. 6-9*), and "*strive to enter the narrow door*" by following Jesus faithfully (*vs. 24*).

132. Please review vs. 14-32.  vs. 14 for the Believer, but also the rest Christ testifies of the works He does because He sees the father doing, He and the Father are one,  I don't need a repeat of Christ's authority, that has already been well established.

John lists the testimonies confirming Jesus‚Äô identity: **John the Baptist** (*vs. 33-35*), **The works of Jesus** (*vs. 36*), **The Father Himself** (*vs. 37*), **The Scriptures** (*vs. 39*). **_Christ is presented as_** equal to the Father and the one sent by the Father to do His work, whose identity is affirmed by these testimonies. **_Believers should_** heed Jesus‚Äô words to *‚ÄúDo not sin anymore‚Äù* (*vs. 14*), trust the multiple testimonies of who Christ is, and receive eternal life by believing in Him (*vs. 24*).

135. Chapter 6 is full of reformer theology, Christ is presented as a sword, offending the religious system. Those that see Jesus will receive eternal life, those the Father has given Me I will certaintly not cast them out.  Feeding the 5000 was one of the miracles recorded in all Gospels.  So please help write a profound impact full 3 sentences with the amazing truth presented in this chapter

12. yes

13. Tweak 1.

14. Tweak 1. I don't spend my recent role as an incident commander, I am identifying low hanging fruit on several servers that are alerting for system load, disk space, CPU and memory issues.  I have made several adjustments to the systems environment through automation and RCA.  I am currently not using splunk, dynatrace, appdynamics or solarwinds.  My cross-functional teams are Level 3 Linux, DBA, GCP and the like, also with middleware application owners.  The cloud is GCP only

15. for tweak 1. I use datadog for out native monitoring solution with GCP.  Also I would like to highlight that this current job role has only been a few months, but before that I was the project manager for the Major Incident management service offering for IBM external clients.    I want that to be in my intro

16. What excites me .. apply my experience in Major incidednt management, working closely with a collaborated team members to identify, quickly remediate the issue, then do a deep dive to answer the 5 w's and provide a consice report to stakeholders for prevention measure

17. Tweak #2. As a contractor for Autodesk, we used the Agile methodology, we recorded extensive Runbooks, and BPM documentation using Confluence. 1 major outage event happened a couple of years in a row during christmas break (hardest to find oncall during that time period).  AWS experienced heavy traffic loads in our primary infrastructure region.  We worked diligently to contact our oncall personnel to try and spin up infrastructure in another region. The lessons learned the first go around was to develop a DR site in another region.  The next year AWS had a similar issue and we were able to reroute traffic to the DR site reducing downtime dramatically

21. As incident commander, my job was to quickly assess the severity impact, coordinate the triage bridge, start communications to the public and delegate the checking of monitoring alerts, customer impact, and transcribing a time line including when the impact started.    Handling high-severity incidents requires a structured approach, clear communication, and ability to stay focused. I immediately establish a communication bridge with key stakeholders, to align on the issue and begin triage. My priority is to quickly assess the situation by gathering data from the monitoring tools alerts, and application metrics.

23. As an Incident Commander, my role was to quickly assess the severity and impact, coordinate the triage bridge, and initiate real-time communication with stakeholders and the public. I ensured that key responsibilities were delegated, such as assigning monitoring health checks and log file review to the on-call for the service. Assigning customer impact severity to the MI Reporter and Customer liaison.   And assigning documentation of a detailed incident timeline, including when the impact began to the scribe of the incident (Usually my fellow IC).

25. "One example that stands out is when I was contracting for Autodesk, and we experienced major AWS traffic overloads in our primary region during the holiday season. The first time this occurred, we faced challenges coordinating on-call personnel to spin up infrastructure in another region, leading to extended downtime. After conducting a thorough root cause analysis (5 Whys), we established a disaster recovery (DR) site in a secondary region. The following year, when AWS had a similar issue, we were able to quickly reroute traffic to the DR site, significantly reducing downtime and business impact.

27. What monitoring tools have I used:  ‚Ä¢	List relevant tools mentioned in the job description. ‚Ä¢	Briefly explain how you‚Äôve used them. I‚Äôve used Splunk, HDS, New Relic, Grafana for SLI/SLO, Datadog, Solarwinds, Nagios, AWS Cloudwatch,

14. Do the same for this post: Systems Administrator ‚Ä¢	Early on in my career I started out as a Systems administrator, working with Manufacturing processing tools, I designed a networked hardware platform in OS/2 Warp for improved performance and reducing manufacturing scrap and equipment down time by several million dollars a year. ‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve encountered several monitoring tools, integration into ticketing systems and countless troubleshooting processes in managing Infrastructure servers.  From AD account cleanup automation (PS script), to working with Zendesk. ‚Ä¢	I am a pioneer in the Linux operating system and have experience in several distros from CentOS, to Ubuntu and all others in between.  "At dawn, I used my cat to peek inside a file, hoping to get the right config, but had to check top to see what was eating my CPU‚Äîturns out, I should‚Äôve just looked in the logs and followed the tail!" üòÜ ‚Ä¢	I do have several years and certifications for working with Windows Active Directory and IIS servers, I can do it.  Don‚Äôt like to, but I do it. ‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve helped build the Sony Pictures infrastructure after the data breach.  We redesigned their entire infrastructure using RHEL, AIX, Ansible, Solarwinds, Nagios, Puppet, and Chef.

16. Incident Commander / Cloud Operations Engineer ‚Ä¢	At Autodesk I was a Cloud Operations Engineer and Incident Response team member.  Using the agile methodology and DevOps work structure, I designed Runbooks, BPM Documents, and communication template documents, and troubleshot SaaS platform infrastructure using Splunk monitoring with HDS, New Relic, DataDog and Grafana. Also we monitored the cloud environment using Cloudwatch. Ran Major Incidents including P0 ‚Äì P2.  Improving the infrastructure with the results from each postmortem, communication templates to public customers of the SaaS

18. Not sure if I should bash on IBM but it would demonstrate why I want to leave IBM and work for a company that wants to help veterans  Project Manager for Major Incident Management Service Offering ‚Ä¢	After our contract ended, (not something Autodesk and Taos wanted, but IBM raised the price). We spent a month working with the replacement contract company.  All of which the whole team was not at all happy with.  The relationship we had felt like we were Autodesk Employees, and if it wasn‚Äôt for the NDA or can‚Äôt work for the company we contracted with our team would all be employees there. ‚Ä¢	Anyways we began working for IBM to develop a Major Incident Management Service Offering that we could provide for our external clients. I became the project manager/lead to develop the service.  I developed the tool set to use for this efficient service using ServiceNow solution that integrated all components for a successful Major incident.  Ticketing, Paging, meeting transcription, log file analysis, and Communications to stakeholders. ‚Ä¢	I designed both an Operational Readiness Review, and a Production Readiness Review checklists ‚Ä¢	I embedded the IBM Cloud Associate SRE practices and agile methodology in providing a Postmortem Analysis.  ServiceNow would use its AI to generate the PA report as it collected all the incident information all within the ticketing system ‚Ä¢	We were not able to move forward due to IBM‚Äôs mission to make money they felt we would be better utilized by reducing ticket load from existing clients

## Refresh NAS Mount RHEL

1. How do you refresh an nas mount in RHEL 7.9

2. how you set color for vi

3. This RHEL 7.9 system is having issues with basic network communication, it required a local hosts file so it can resolve its DNS name and relevent local systems. Ping errors for socket, the fstab file required an nas connection that the other systems did not require.  It looks like it was manually fixed but it was only bandaid fix, it historically is slow, because it was failing to connect to a nas server, and in /var/log/messages excessive system load how can I check the heath of the network services

4. I think the CPU process for 'rpm' is causing the problems, it is trying to reach the Redhat Satellite server.  the error I am getting in /var/log/messages   Feb  4 21:09:42 [problemserver] goferd: [ERROR][worker-0] gofer.messaging.adapter.connect:33 - connect: proton+amqps://redhatsatellite.net:5647, failed: Connection amqps://redhatsatellite.net:5647 disconnected: Condition('proton.pythonio', 'Connection refused to all addresses')

5. How do I uninstall all references to using Red Hat Satellite or disable it, I did the unregister and it is still erroring in /var/log/messages

6. looks like the healthy system is getting the same errors, but it doesn't seem to be an issue.  Since I unregistered and cleaned the satellite server the problem system seems to be responding well.  So I am going to leave that part as is

7. So the healthy system has mounted a NAS server that is not listed in its /etc/fstab. With the problem system I removed the entries to the NAS server to match that of the healthy fstab file.  what can I check on the healthy system to find out how it mounted the NAS server

8. systemd mount is possibly being used by the healthy system, however it has this in the directory: /etc/systemd/system/remote-fs.target.wants/nfs-client.target -> /usr/lib/systemd/system/nfs-client.target

9. how can I use find the .mount files

10. I need to traverse directories to find the .mount files

11. I want to traverse the subdirectories

12. there is some files in /proc/ mounts and net going to self/mount self/net

13. how can I use systemd and setup the mounts I need, Configure systemd to mount my nas server

## Starting Bible Study Tips

1. How to start a bible study when the leader doesn't know everyone's spiritual condition

2. I want to start with the joke about the pastor who didn't want to go to church one sunday

3. Definition of doctrine and theology

4. can you help me write probing questions and list items are prompts for me:  ## Ice breaker Johnny woke up one Sunday morning and decided he didn‚Äôt want to go to church that day. He felt tired and uninspired, he would just rather go fishin.  He said to his wife, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go today. The sermon is always too long and boring, the people don‚Äôt like me, and I‚Äôm not sure I like them either.‚Äù  His wife, who was already getting ready, looked at him and said, ‚ÄúWell Johnny, you have to go.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù he asked.  She replied, ‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre the pastor!‚Äù  "It‚Äôs a funny reminder that we all sometimes feel unmotivated or uncertain, even on Sunday mornings. But often, when we push through those feelings, we find that God meets us exactly where we are‚Äîsometimes in surprising ways. That‚Äôs part of what makes studying the Bible together so powerful. No matter where we‚Äôre coming from today, God has something to say to each of us.  ## Greetings Grace and Peace to you from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thank you all for taking the time out of your busy schedules, or not busy schedules to come and dive into the Word of God.  I pray that through this study we all will draw closer to our Master and King Jesus Christ. If any of you don't know Jesus, I welcome you too and pray this study will reveal to you the real Christ, King and Living God, and with a repentent heart surrender yourself and come to know Him as your personal Lord and Saviour.  ## In the Beginning God **Genesis 1:1-5** > *In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. And the earth was a formless and desolate emptiness, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. Then God said, ‚ÄúLet there be light‚Äù; and there was light. God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light ‚Äúday,‚Äù and the darkness He called ‚Äúnight.‚Äù And there was evening and there was morning, one day.*  **John 1:1-5** > *In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not even one thing came into being that has come into being. In Him was life, and the life was the Light of mankind. And the Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not grasp it.*  - I am not sure if you were aware but we are planning to study Verse by Verse Ministries group study on the End times.  After today's study I will provide the link to the study guide and materials for the study  - Interesting that I would begin at the beginning to talk about the 66th book of the Bible.  - Before we begin the Bible study on the end times, We need to know how to interpret scripture, The End Times study is full of Old testament references, so in order for us to interpret the Last book of the Bible, we need to have a very good understanding of the Old Testament.    ### **The Message of the Bible**  > **Christcentric - John 5:39** - *You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me;* > > The NEW is in the OLD contained - the OLD is in the NEW explained   > The NEW is in the OLD concealed - the OLD is in the NEW revealed  The entirety of Scripture declares that the person and work of Jesus Christ is the central theme. He is the promised King, the Redeemer of God‚Äôs people, and the One through whom God‚Äôs glory is displayed. The Bible‚Äôs narrative demonstrates that all things exist for the glory of God, as Paul proclaims: *"For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever."* **(Romans 11:36)**.   ### Proofs of a Grand Designer  1. Godhead Is mentioned, The Son is described as the Word and the Light 2. The light represents and is Christ 3. Darkness was created, not just the absence of light 4. God's plan is already in motion, creating darkness  **Is. 45:6-7**    > That men may know from the rising to the setting of the sun  > That there is no one besides Me.  > I am the LORD, and there is no other, > The One forming light and creating darkness,  > Causing  well-being and creating calamity;  > I am the LORD who does all these.   ### Questions

5. based on my post can you create the bible study script

6. The emphasis of this study is to show God demonstrating His perfected characteristic.  He introduces space for evil to reside (Darkness), even before He created man.  He wanted to  reveal all of His characteristics to mankind

7. Can you review and edit: 2. **Genesis 1 and John 1**      - What does ‚ÄúIn the beginning, God‚Äù teach us about His sovereignty and role as Creator?     - How does He introduce Himself?    - What is the first words He speaks?    - What is the significance of the statement: "God saw that the light was good"?    - How does God reveal is plan of redemption even early on in these 5 verses.    - How did God reveal He is the originator of the scientific laws?

8. If you confess with your mouth what bible verse

9. for all have sinned

10. conform to Jesus

11. conform till the day of Christ Jesus

12. King Saul holy spirit

13. First importance

14. When is Veteran's day

7. I need something more to end the chapter 7:  Outside the Tower, in the fields near Bethlehem, the quiet night stretched on as the shepherds kept watch. The soft bleating of lambs and the rustle of the wind in the grass were the only sounds beneath the vast, starry sky. Shepherding was seen as a lowly task, and these men often felt forgotten by society. But on this night, for these lowly shepherds, something amazing was about to happen‚Äîsomething that would change their lives forever. Suddenly, the peaceful night sky exploded with a brilliant light. The shepherds gasped and covered their faces, trembling with fear. Their hearts raced, and they fell to their knees, overwhelmed by what they were seeing. It felt like they were in the presence of something beyond human understanding. Just when they thought they couldn‚Äôt bear it any longer, a warm and calming feeling washed over them. Then, a gentle voice spoke, full of kindness and reassurance. "Don‚Äôt be afraid," the angel said softly. His words, like a soothing melody, eased their fear. The shepherds, still shaken but no longer terrified, listened closely. "I have good news for you‚Äînews that will bring great joy to everyone! Today, in the city of David, a Savior has been born for you. He is Christ the Lord. Here‚Äôs how you‚Äôll know it‚Äôs Him: you‚Äôll find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger." Before the shepherds could even respond, the sky above them filled with countless angels. Their voices rang out in perfect harmony, filling the night with a song of praise: "Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those with whom He is pleased!" And just as quickly as they had appeared, the angels were gone. Silence returned, but the shepherds were forever changed. They stood in awe, still feeling the warmth of the angel‚Äôs words and the beauty of the heavenly song.

8. remember Jesus was born in the Tower Migdal Eder

10. What do you think of the rewrite of Chapter 8:  "Without a moment‚Äôs hesitation, they rose to their feet, their fear replaced by an urgent sense of purpose. This was not a night to stay silent or remain still. They had been entrusted with something far greater than themselves‚Äîa message of hope, joy, and peace. ‚ÄúWe must go,‚Äù one of them whispered, his voice trembling with excitement. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to the Tower of the Flock and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about!‚Äù And so, with hearts full of wonder and feet swift with excitement, the shepherds set off toward the ancient tower of Migdal Eder. The place where lambs meant for sacrifice were born now cradled the greatest Lamb of all.  As they neared the familiar tower, its ancient stones gleamed faintly in the moonlight. This was the place where they had always tended lambs destined for sacrifice, yet tonight, it felt different, the Tower was on Holy ground, and so before they entered they removed their sandals.  They entered the humble shelter, and there, in the soft glow of lamplight, they saw Him‚Äîthe baby wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger, just as the angel had said. Tears welled in their eyes as they knelt before the child and worshipped Him.  This was no ordinary child. He was the Lamb of God, and at that moment, the shepherds knew they were witnessing something far greater than they had ever imagined. Heaven touched the earth in this very location, where lowly shepherds, in an insignificant town, in a lowly manger lay the creator of the universe.  With hearts overflowing, the shepherds left the tower, eager to share the incredible news. They didn‚Äôt care that they were considered lowly by others; they had been entrusted with the greatest message of all time. As they made their way back through the fields, their voices rose joyfully, proclaiming to all who would listen:  ‚ÄúThe Savior has been born! We have seen Him‚Äîthe Lamb of God, lying in a manger!‚Äù "

14. Can you just fix this paragraph:  As they approached, the tower‚Äôs ancient stones shone faintly in the moonlight. This place seemed to glow as if the Tower was on Holy ground. They drew closer cautiously, hesitant. Without saying a word, the shepherds took off their sandals

15. In this paragraph, I want to emphasize the worship of the shepherds, it was a long moment in deep reverence and humble repentence. They came to saving faith, it seemed to last longer than the moment they knelt down

16. Rewrite this text at the reading level of a middle schooler.

17. this ending is not as good as what we have before it, can we close this with the same passion as the other paragraphs before it:  Overflowing with joy, the shepherds left the tower, eager to spread the news. They didn‚Äôt care that most people saw them as unimportant. They knew they had been given the greatest message ever. Even as they returned to their fields, the shepherds knew their lives had changed forever. They had seen the Lamb of God, and they carried the light of that night in their hearts.  As they walked back through the fields, they couldn‚Äôt hold back their excitement. Their voices rang out joyfully to anyone who would listen:  ‚ÄúThe Savior has been born! We saw Him‚Äîthe Lamb of God, lying in a manger!‚Äù

18. Rewrite this text at the reading level of a middle schooler.

19. Completing the book with Chapter 9 focusing on the Tower, is it the way to end the book and if so can you provide the same level of emotion to the last chapter

20. I think there is some repetitive statements within the chapter and that was already in the other parts of the story, as well as descriptions of the Tower, can you modify these first

21. Rewrite this text at the reading level of a middle schooler.

22. Instead of ending the book with this ending, maybe we should write the last chapter as the tower looked upon a man with 12 men and some women following Him, He stops on the road and sees a man with lepersy, touches and heals him. The Man glancing at the tower, and seeing the sheep and shepherds He speaks about being the good shepherd

23. include John 10:1-4 and 7-15 in the chapter, also the ending should emphasize that the tower maybe gone the story is still unfolding today, with humble shepherds despised and rejected lowly poor proclaiming the greatest true story.  Maybe add the Matthew 5 beatitudes to describe those of us who are the shepherds

27. Can you rewrite this chapter in Middleschool level reading?  Chapter 5: The Journey to Bethlehem The roads leading to Bethlehem were bustling with travelers. The Roman Emperor had ordered a census, and families from far and wide returned to their ancestral towns to be registered. Among the many travelers was a young couple from Nazareth‚ÄîJoseph, a carpenter, and Mary, his wife, who was carrying a very special child.  As they made their way along the dusty paths, the fields of Bethlehem Ephrathah(which means ‚Äúplace where Rachel died‚Äù). stretched out before them. The sun hung low in the sky, casting a warm golden glow across the rolling hills. Mary sat quietly on the back of a donkey, her hands resting gently on her growing belly. Joseph walked beside her, guiding their way with care. Every so often, he glanced at her, concern flickering in his eyes, for the time of her delivery was drawing near.  As the couple drew closer to Bethlehem, they passed fields where shepherds tended their sheep beneath the fading sunlight. Mary took in the peaceful scene, feeling a quiet sense of calm. She couldn‚Äôt help but recall the stories Joseph had told her‚Äîstories of this very land‚Äôs rich history. This was the land where Ruth had gleaned grain and found a kinsman redeemer, and where David, the shepherd boy, had been anointed as king.  Joseph‚Äôs eyes lifted toward a nearby tower. It looked ancient, its stones worn and weathered by time. The Tower of the Flock stood humbly atop a hill, blending seamlessly into the landscape as if it had always been part of the earth. Though he didn‚Äôt fully understand why, something about the sight of the Tower gave him hope. He gently squeezed Mary‚Äôs hand, offering her silent reassurance. They had traveled far, and though the road had been long and difficult, Joseph trusted in what the Angel had told him. ‚ÄúJoseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for the Child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a Son; and you shall name Him Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.‚Äù (Matthew 1:20-21) As the sky darkened and night began to fall, the distant lights of Bethlehem flickered like tiny stars, welcoming the weary travelers. They pressed on toward the town.

Chapter 6: Under the Shadow of the Tower The weary couple finally arrived in Bethlehem, only to find the town crowded with travelers. The narrow streets were bustling with people‚Äîfamilies unloading their donkeys, merchants calling out their wares, and children weaving through the crowds with excitement. Every inn was full, and the warm glow of lanterns flickered in windows, signaling that all rooms were occupied. Joseph‚Äôs heart grew heavy as he searched desperately for shelter, knocking on door after door, but every place was already taken. The air buzzed with voices and the clatter of footsteps, a constant reminder of how full the little town had become.  With no other choice, they left busy Bethlehem behind and ventured into the cold, quiet night. As they moved away from the bustling town, Joseph‚Äôs eyes caught the familiar outline of the Tower of the Flock, silhouetted against the starry sky. A soft glow spilled from the entrance, almost as if it were beckoning the exhausted but grateful couple to come and rest within its walls. Though it was just a simple shelter, Joseph felt a sense of calm wash over him. He gently guided Mary toward the tower, trusting that here, they would find warmth and protection.  Inside, the air was still and peaceful. The thick stone walls sheltered them from the chill of the night, and fresh straw covered the floor, offering a soft place to rest. It wasn‚Äôt grand or adorned with riches, but it was enough‚Äîa humble refuge for a holy moment, a perfect place for a perfect plan to unfold.  That night, inside the ancient Tower, Mary gave birth to her son. She wrapped Him in swaddling cloths and laid Him in a manger filled with soft straw. Outside, the fields were quiet except for the gentle rustling of sheep and the occasional murmur of the shepherds keeping watch.

31. Can you rewrite this chapter at the level of middleschool  As the years passed, the fields near Migdal Eder took on even greater importance. These fields were now tended by special shepherds‚ÄîLevitical shepherds‚Äîpriests who had been given a sacred responsibility. They weren‚Äôt just ordinary caretakers of sheep; their task was to raise lambs that would be offered as sacrifices in the Temple of Jerusalem.  The lambs born in these fields had to be without blemish‚Äîcompletely perfect‚Äîbecause they would be used for the most important sacrifices, including the Passover lamb, which reminded the people of how God had rescued them from Egypt. The shepherds worked carefully, ensuring that every lamb was spotless. If a lamb was found to be perfect, they wrapped it gently in soft swaddling cloths to keep it clean and safe. Then, they placed it in a manger, where it could rest quietly, unblemished, and protected.  The Tower no longer just provided shelter from storms; it had become a place tied to God‚Äôs promise of salvation. It had seen generations of shepherds tending their flocks, but now it watched something sacred taking place. Each lamb wrapped in cloths and placed in a manger was a shadow of a greater Lamb to come‚Äîthe Lamb of God who would one day take away the sins of the world.  The fields of Migdal Eder were peaceful, but there was a sense of quiet anticipation, as if creation itself was holding its breath. The Tower, ancient and steadfast, stood at the center of it all‚Äîwatching, waiting, knowing that soon, God‚Äôs greatest promise would be fulfilled.

32. The chapter should start with David assigning these fields and the tower the very important task

34. Chapter before states: One day, David would return to these fields‚Äînot as a shepherd boy, but as a mighty king, chosen by God. And when David became king, he never forgot the fields where he had tended sheep or the Tower that had stood watch over him. He dedicated this very area to a special purpose and a special flock.  So can you introduce this chapter with that in mind

36. Can you rewrite this paragraph in middleschool level?  Boaz, became Ruth and Naomi‚Äôs kinsman redeemer, their story is a beautiful picture of God‚Äôs plan of redemption. The fields where Boaz and Ruth‚Äôs story unfolded near Bethlehem were later the very fields where shepherds would watch over lambs destined for sacrifice at the Temple in Jerusalem. And in those same fields, the ultimate Passover Lamb would be born there, the One who would redeem not just a single family, but all who would trust in Him.

37. Can you provide all scripture references to the Migdal Eder Tower of the flock, I know Gen 35, Micah 4:8 and 5:2 maybe strong tower in ESV format

38. Can you provide scripture that refers to Jesus as the Son of my sorrow and the son of my right hand in ESV

39. In these paragraphs about Boaz and Ruth, instead of speaking about the passover lamb, I want to bring up the ultimate kinsman redeemer being born in these very fields, also add a bible verse about Jesus as the redeemer

40. One day, Boaz, the owner of the fields, came to meet Ruth. He was a kind and generous man who admired Ruth‚Äôs loyalty to Naomi. He ensured she had enough grain to take home, offering her provision and kindness. Day by day, as the tower watched, their friendship grew, and eventually, Boaz became Ruth‚Äôs kinsman redeemer‚Äîthe one who would rescue and care for her family. He married Ruth, giving her a new beginning and restoring hope to her and Naomi.‚Äã  ‚Äã  Their story is a beautiful picture of God‚Äôs perfect plan for redeeming His people. And in those very fields, the greatest Passover Lamb would be born‚Äîthe One who would come to save not just one family, but everyone who trusts in Him.

41. Is there another scripture maybe in Hebrews?

42. Can you rewrite this paragraph, keep it the same length and middleschool level and build a better climax: The Tower of the Flock, once a simple shelter, now had a sacred role. It stood as a quiet guardian, watching over generations of shepherds and their special flocks. Every lamb wrapped in cloths and placed in a manger pointed to something even greater. Though the fields around Migdal Eder were calm and peaceful, it felt as if something important was about to happen.

43. The Tower was sensing that it would too play an important part in it

45. Can you expand this paragraph in middleschool level: Before the shepherds could even respond, the sky above them filled with countless angels. Their voices rang out in perfect harmony, filling the night with a song of praise: "Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those with whom He is pleased!" And just as quickly as they had appeared, the angels were gone. Silence returned, and though the fields were once again cloaked in darkness, to the shepherds, the world around them didn‚Äôt feel the same. They had heard a message meant for kings and rulers, yet it was delivered to them‚Äîlowly shepherds.

46. Can you provide a Kindle publishing summary for this book

47. Provide Kindle publishing 7 key words for this book

48. Can you modify this sentence and eliminate the repeat? One day, Boaz, the owner of the fields, came to meet Ruth. He was a kind and generous man who admired Ruth‚Äôs loyalty to Naomi. He made sure she had plenty of grain to take home, showing her kindness and care.

49. regen it

50. More creativity and poetic

51. Review the book of Ruth in ESV, focus on 3 paragraphs, 1st paragraph focuses on Boaz provision to Ruth, 2nd the Kinsman Redeemer and the 3rd introduction to David quoting scripture if applicable, specifically for provision Ruth 2:14-16.  the second as Christ our Redeemer, noting that He will be Boaz and Ruth's kinsman redeemer.  The third just an introduction of the bloodline to David from Boaz.  This is what I have now, so make it about the same length, maybe a sentence longer:  One day, Boaz, the owner of the fields, came to meet Ruth. He was a kind and generous man who admired Ruth‚Äôs loyalty to Naomi. He made sure she had plenty of grain to take home, showing her kindness and care. Day by day, as the tower watched, their friendship grew. Eventually, Boaz became Ruth‚Äôs kinsman redeemer‚Äîthe one who rescued and cared for her family. He married Ruth, giving her a new beginning and restoring hope to both her and Naomi.‚Äã  ‚Äã  Their story is a beautiful picture of God‚Äôs perfect plan to redeem His people. And in those very fields near the Tower of the Flock, the ultimate Kinsman Redeemer would one day be born‚ÄîJesus, who became like us so He could rescue and restore us. ‚Äã  ‚Äã  From the family of Ruth and Boaz came a son Obed, and then a grandson, named Jesse. And from Jesse‚Äôs family came a young shepherd boy named David‚Äîwho would one day be king.

52. Can it be more poetic love story in Middleschool reading level

53. At the end of this page, I want to introduce David as the shepherd only, and then introduce the one who would be the ultimate kinsman redeemer that would redeem not only this family line but all who put their faith and trust in Him.  Be sure to have that at the end, and not repeated:  One day, Boaz, came to notice Ruth gleaning in his fields. Boaz was a kind and generous man who had a deep admiration for Ruth‚Äôs unwavering loyalty to Naomi. Day after day, the Tower watched as their friendship grew. Boaz would continue to provide generously to Ruth and Naomi.‚Äã  ‚Äã  In time, Boaz married Ruth and became her kinsman redeemer, along with Naomi, he stepped in and rescued and restored her family, providing them with hope. ‚Äã  ‚Äã  Their love story became a picture of God‚Äôs perfect plan to redeem His people Just as Boaz redeemed Ruth, Jesus, the ultimate Kinsman Redeemer, came to rescue us. He became one of us so He could save not just one family, but all who would trust in Him.‚Äã  ‚Äã  From the love of Ruth and Boaz came a son named Obed, and from him, a grandson named Jesse. It was through this family came a shepherd boy named David.

54. can this be more poetic, not so factual and stoic.  paint a beautiful picture with the words for this is a love story

55. I want this paragraph to state that through this family line a great plan of redemption was unfolding, as if the family line was part of this great plan of redemption:  From the love of Ruth and Boaz came a son, Obed. From Obed came a grandson, Jesse. And from Jesse‚Äôs family came a young shepherd boy named David.  From his family‚Äôs story a far greater plan was unfolding. From this humble line would come the ultimate Kinsman Redeemer, the One who would redeem not just a single family, but all who look to Him in faith.

56. I need a better word other than steadfast (repeated):  The Tower of the Flock, now had a sacred purpose. It stood like a steadfast guardian, watching over shepherds and their special flocks raised for the Temple. Every spotless perfect lamb seemed to point toward something far greater.

57. faithful sentinel, would middleschool readers know what that is?  The Tower of the Flock now had a sacred purpose. It stood like a faithful sentinel, watching over shepherds and their special flocks raised for the Temple. Every spotless, perfect lamb seemed to point toward something far greater.

58. How about resilient

59. would middleschool level students know what resilient means, i guess i want to describe a strong tower

60. I want to convey that the shepherds now figured out that the "Sign" the angel gave was pointing to the passover lambs were born in the Tower, and now the Ultimate Passover Lamb is lying in that same manger.

2. All the stones need to not be so geometric, and the tower, should be natural looking

3. Tower needs to be taller and the stone for jacob should the much smaller, something he could carry

4. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-3z6tqAy21xcYMHJHkmMhLb", "size_bytes": 30360, "width": 468, "height": 169, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

5. Based on this text can you provide the same format image (16:8) and scripture references in ESV for the paragraph:  Long ago, in the quiet hills of a region called Canaan (modern-day Israel), there stood a special tower named Migdal Eder, which means ‚ÄúThe Tower of the Flock.‚Äù Built from strong stones, each perfectly placed as if a master architect had carefully laid them, the tower had stood for generations. It had weathered countless storms that tried to shake it from its solid rock foundation, yet it remained steadfast. Ancient and timeless, it seemed the tower had been placed there when the world was formed‚Äîan enduring presence providing shelter and safety for shepherds and their flocks, protecting them from prowling animals and fierce winds.

6. No, Lets create an illustration that is formatted (16:8), of the tower of the flock, migdal eder, that looks like its base blends in with the hillside and is ancient but strong looking, its architecture is natural looking as if it blends in with rolling hills, it is round but rough shaped each stone perfectly placed, weathered.

## Tower Flock Images

1. title chat session migdaleder

2. Using the formatted Markdown language in MigdalEder.pdf and its style of storytelling (narration done with scripture verses, and images). Add the extra information from the "The witness of the Pasture and the Tower.pdf" to a story about the perspective of the MigdalEder tower. Include a narration sheet separate from the story

3. from this section can you provide a chapter 1 story for kids with a small emphsis on the tower's perspective as God the Father:The first book of the Bible tells us that it was under the watch of this tower that Jacob, the  father of the 12 tribes of Israel, lost his wife Rachel.  Rachel died after the birth of her second son Benjamin. As she passed away, in her pain and  sadness, she named her baby Ben-Oni, which means the son of my sorrow. Jacob instead called  the boy Ben-Yamin, the son of my right hand. I imagine that Jacob didn‚Äôt want to be constantly  reminded of the loss of Rachel. He loved her so much that he spent 14 years working for her  father to gain her hand in marriage. How tragic is it for the boy‚Äôs very name to be the constant    reminder of the consequence of his own birth. And as the end of this story will reveal, it turns  out that ‚Äòthe son of my right hand‚Äô is the only name appropriate here

4. can we stick to the content and voice of the original format in the "MigdalEder.pdf" and just add sections for Ruth and David

5. so far it looks good, however it needs to read like a children story, also tie Ruth and Jacob's loss and to David as the Great great grandson of Ruth and Boaz. all under the watchful eye of the tower

6. here is my revised Chapter 1: ### Chapter 1: The Tower of the Flock #### The Sorrow and the Right Hand  > *And Jacob set up a memorial stone over her grave; that is the memorial stone of Rachel‚Äôs grave to this day. Then Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder."* (**Genesis 35:21**) >  Long ago, in the rolling hills of Canaan, a special tower stood tall above the fields. It was called *Migdal Eder* ‚Äî the Tower of the Flock. Built of sturdy stones, this watchtower was a shelter for shepherds and their flocks. At its base were pens where sheep could safely rest, and inside, shepherds carefully tended to the lambs, especially those born in the cool of night.  It had watched over the sheep and shepherds for many years, standing strong as a silent reminder of God‚Äôs care. But the tower also saw the deep sadness of a man named Jacob.  Jacob‚Äôs heart was heavy as he placed a stone near the tower. His beloved wife, Rachel, had just passed away after giving birth to their son. With her last breath, she had named him Ben-Oni, which means "son of my sorrow." But Jacob, through his tears, gave him a new name: Benjamin, "son of my right hand."  > *The Lord is my shepherd, I will not be in need. He lets me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters.* (**Psalms 23:1-2**)  The tower stood still, its shadow stretching over Jacob as he mourned. It had seen his loss, but it also saw the love Jacob had for his family. The tower, like God the Father, watched over Jacob and Benjamin, silently reminding them that sorrow could be turned into hope. As Jacob begins to leave, the shepherds return to their work, under the watchful eye of the tower, keeping them safe.  ![Shepherd wrapping lamb](/images/towerShepherd.jpg)

7. Can you generate an image of Ruth gleaning in the fields with the Tower in the background

8. review my changes and make any tweaks to the grammer and puncuation if nessecary:  ### Chapter 2: The Kinsman Redeemer  > *"May you be richly rewarded by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge."* (**Ruth 2:12**)  Years passed, and the tower continued to watch over the fields. One day, it noticed a woman named Ruth working hard to gather grain. Ruth was not from Bethlehem; she was from Moab. But she had chosen to stay with her mother-in-law, Naomi, after losing her husband. Ruth‚Äôs kindness and loyalty shone brightly, even in her sadness.  As Ruth worked, the tower saw a man named Boaz, the owner of the fields, take notice of her. Boaz was kind and generous, making sure Ruth had enough grain to take home. The tower watched as their friendship grew, and eventually, Boaz became Ruth‚Äôs kinsman redeemer. He married her and gave her a new beginning.  Ruth and Boaz grandson, Jesse would become the father of David, the shepherd who would one day become a king. Ruth‚Äôs story of loss and love reminded the tower of God‚Äôs promise to take care of His people, no matter where they came from.  ---  ### Chapter 3: The Anointed and Awaited King  > *"Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon David."* (**1 Samuel 16:13**)  The fields near the Migdal Eder were peaceful as a young shepherd named David tended his father‚Äôs sheep. The tower had seen David many times, singing songs to God as he cared for the flock. But one day, something very special happened.  The prophet Samuel came to visit David‚Äôs family. God had sent Samuel to anoint the next king of Israel, and to everyone‚Äôs surprise, God chose David, the youngest brother. The tower watched as Samuel poured oil over David‚Äôs head, marking him as the future king. The Spirit of the Lord filled David, and the tower could almost feel the excitement of what was to come.  David would grow up to be a great king, but he never forgot the fields where he had cared for his sheep. The tower stood tall, always vigilent, having witnessed the beginning of David‚Äôs incredible journey, as the man after God's own heart.  ---

9. can I get an image of young David in the fields with his sheep, slingshot on his belt, and the tower above him

10. David did not have a bow and arrow it was a slingshot

11. can you lose the bow and arrows

12. remove the arrows sheath and replace it with a shepherds staff

13. Still see the arrows on his back and the bow, the shepherd's staff has a hook large enough to wrap it around a sheep's neck

14. how about just a young boy with a shepherd's staff and the tower in the backdrop and sheep

15. Using both the chapter of shepherd priests and the newborn lamb from "migdaleder.pdf" and the following can you rewrite this chapter?  The Passover Lambs  Under David, the Tabernacle of God and the Arc of the Covenant were moved to Jerusalem. The Jewish Mishna suggests that the temple flock and the attending shepherds were then established, near Jerusalem in Bethlehem - the same fields where David managed his father‚Äôs flock as a young man.   So the Levitical shepherds were at Bethlehem Ephrathah, in the fields of David. According to Rabbinic tradition, the shepherds would keep watch from the shepherding towers in these pastures. When a ewe began to deliver her lamb, these shepherds brought her into the base of the Migdal Eder to deliver. This facility was not the typical filthy dwelling of livestock. It was the ritually cleansed birthing place of the potential sacrifices of Israel.   When the unblemished lambs were one year of age, the assigned Priest would come to the Migdal Eder to inspect them, wrap them in swaddling cloths and carry them into Jerusalem, through the Lamb‚Äôs gate, for the Passover sacrifice.   One final point will mark the end of our journey and our arrival at the nativity.

16. help me modify this so it reads better, and is also understandable to kids  ### Chapter 4: The Shepherd Priests and the Newborn Lamb  > *As for you, tower of the flock, hill of the daughter of Zion, to you it will come‚Äîyes, the former dominion will come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem."* (**Micah 4:8**)  > *Now the Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, ‚ÄúThis month shall be the beginning of months for you; it is to be the first month of the year for you. Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, ‚ÄòOn the tenth of this month they are, each one, to take a lamb for themselves, according to the fathers‚Äô households, a lamb for each household. Your lamb shall be an unblemished male a year old; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats.*  Several hundred years later, the fields of Bethlehem Ephrathah became known not only for their connection to David but for a sacred purpose. Under King David‚Äôs reign, the Tabernacle of God and the Ark of the Covenant were moved to Jerusalem, and these fields‚Äîthe very ones where David had once tended his sheep‚Äîbecame a place of great importance. According to Jewish tradition, these were the fields where the Temple flocks were kept.  The Levitical shepherds who cared for these flocks were not ordinary shepherds. They were priestly guardians of the lambs destined for sacrifice at the Temple of God. The tower, Migdal Eder, stood as their watchtower, offering protection and a vantage point over the sacred fields. When a ewe was ready to give birth, the shepherds would bring her into the lower chambers of the tower. This space was kept ceremonially clean, prepared for the arrival of lambs that would one day be offered at the Temple.  The tower watched as each newborn lamb was carefully inspected. Only those without blemish‚Äîperfect in every way‚Äîcould be used for sacrifices. The shepherds wrapped these lambs in swaddling cloths to protect them and laid them in mangers carved from stone. Here they rested, safe and unblemished, until the day they would be carried to Jerusalem through the Lamb‚Äôs Gate for Passover.  The tower, standing tall and steadfast, marveled at the precision of God‚Äôs plan. Each lamb, born and cared for in its shadow, foreshadowed a greater sacrifice yet to come.  ![Shepherd wrapping lamb](/images/towerShepherd.jpg)  ---

17. On to the chapter of the angels and the signs of the manger "medgaleder.pdf" combine it with:   Now, for the story that we know so well. Joseph and a very pregnant Mary arrive in Bethlehem, where there is no room at the inn, so they are forced to take shelter in an old wooden barn and use a feed trough as a cradle for the Savior of the World. No doubt, the lowliness of His birth is intended by scripture, and is an important thing to internalize. But there is also another point here. It‚Äôs just as important, but maybe not as obvious.   Luke‚Äôs version of the nativity tells us that an angel came to these shepherds, telling them where and how to find the baby Jesus:   ‚ÄúAnd the messenger said to them, ‚ÄúDo not fear, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be to all the people, 11 because today in the city of David a Savior was born to you, who is Christ the LORD! 12 And this [is] the sign to you: you will find a Baby wrapped up [in swaddling strips], lying in the manger.‚Äù Luke 2:10-12 (Young‚Äôs Literal Translation)   My whole life, I wondered how the shepherds knew where to find Christ. Then I heard the tradition of the tower and realized that Jesus wasn‚Äôt in A manger, but rather, He was in THE Manger. This is the birthing stall and the chiseled rock inspection crib of the Passover lambs.   Also, the shepherds would find Jesus wrapped in swaddling cloths ‚Äì the strips used to inspect the Passover lambs. These men knew where those strips were stored. They were in charge of these innocent cute creatures, bound for the sacrificial altar. They had seen them swaddled by the Priest thousands of times. So it made perfect sense that God would inform these men of Christ‚Äôs arrival, and allow them to care for His son at his birth. The shepherds were possibly the only men who grasped the value and symbolism of the Lamb that Christ came to be. They didn‚Äôt have to run through town checking all of the barns. They knew exactly where Jesus was. Because the angel‚Äôs instruction was specific.

18. Can you write the ending from this:  The Shadow, the Image and the Light  Jesus was born, inspected, found to be without blemish and swaddled just like the lamb of sacrifice the night He was born. Later, He was carried (literally carried) into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, like the sacrificial lamb. The specific gate He entered through was the Lamb‚Äôs Gate, just like the sacrificial lamb. He was judged at the Temple of God, and then sacrificed on Passover, just like the sacrificial lamb.   As He was tortured and dying on that cross, He became Ben Oni, the Son of God‚Äôs sorrow. And when He ascended to heaven He was seated at the right hand of God. He became Ben-Yamin, the Son of God‚Äôs right hand, fulfilling the shadow of Jacob‚Äôs grief. When He died, He became our kinsman redeemer paying the price for our restoration, just as Boaz does for Ruth, in Bethlehem. When He said, ‚ÄúIt is finished‚Äù and breathed His last, He became the anointed King, just as David did, in Bethlehem.   A shadow is the image of a thing. It‚Äôs not 3 dimensional like the thing it copies, and it hasn‚Äôt the color and vivid nature of that thing. It is a representation of that thing none-the-less. The light we call God‚Äôs glory had cast a shadow, a representation of our Lord Jesus in the field of the Migdal Eder over many centuries. These shadows of Christ were to be our guideposts to recognize Him when He arrived. On the night of Christ‚Äôs birth, for the first time man was privileged to see in 3 dimensions, in real time and in true vivid color, the subject of the shadow. The subject is Christ.   The witness of the tower and the pasture throughout history is a foreshadowing ‚Äì a shadow of the sorrow, joy and redemptive nature of Christ‚Äôs life. The witness of the tower and the pasture in the Nativity are the precious story of Christ in real time as God fulfilled His plot.

19. can you rewrite chapter 6 for a child to understand it?  Also include the time of His birth coinsides with the Feast of Booths/tabernacles "God dwells with us" underlining that God is perfect in every detail, from the passover lamb, to the time of the festival of booths signifying God with us

22. Can you explain a kinsman redeemer as in the story of Ruth and Boaz so a child can understand that?

23. Can you explain a kinsman redeemer as in the story of Ruth and Boaz so a child can understand that?

24. You could clarify why the Feast of Booths is special and what it looked like during Jesus' time, to help children better visualize the significance.

25. Consider explaining what 'shadows' mean in simpler terms for children, perhaps with a quick example, to make the concept easier to understand.

26. You could add a simple explanation here about what a 'kinsman redeemer' is and how Boaz helped Ruth, using child-friendly language like a 'close family helper' or 'rescuer' to make it clearer for children.

27. Consider simplifying the language here to emphasize how everything led to Jesus in a way that children can easily follow.

28. Can I get an image of Mary and Joseph heading to the tower, the tower windows shining as if a lamp on the inside was a beacon of light drawing them to it

29. can you provide another image, not so many windows in the tower and sheep in the field

30. another image of the manger scene

31. the manger was in the tower

32. can we simplify these paragraphs: Jesus‚Äô birth also happened at a very special time of year‚Äîthe Feast of Booths, or Tabernacles. This was a time when families would build small tents or huts out of branches and leaves. They would live in these huts for a whole week to remember a very important message: God is with us.  During this festival, people celebrated how God stayed close to His people, leading them and providing everything they needed. When Jesus was born during this special time, it was as if God was saying, ‚ÄúNow I have come to live with you in person!‚Äù Jesus‚Äô birth was perfect in every way‚Äîeven the timing‚Äîbecause He came to show that God‚Äôs love is always with us, just like during the Feast of Booths.

33. Chapter 6 combine in 1 paragraph: Jesus‚Äô birth also happened at a very special time of year‚Äîthe Feast of Booths, or Tabernacles. This was a time when families would build small tents or huts out of branches and leaves. They would live in these huts for a whole week to remember how God took care of the Israelites in the wilderness. It was like a big camping trip with a very important message: God is always with us.  During this festival, people celebrated how God stayed close to His people, leading them and providing everything they needed. When Jesus was born during this special time, it was as if God was saying, ‚ÄúNow I have come to live with you in person!‚Äù Jesus‚Äô birth was perfect in every way‚Äîeven the timing‚Äîbecause He came to show that God‚Äôs love is always with us, just like during the Feast of Booths.

## Tower of the Flock Story

1. I want to create a children's story about the Gen 35:21 "Tower of the flock" and Jesus being born in that manger (tower), and used swaddling cloths to be wrapped in.  Micah also tells of this tower, where? 5:2 talks of Bethlehem

2. Is there other scripture that reference the tower as the one used to raise the special sheep for the temple.  I know it was mentioned in Gen 35, what was it used back then?

3. yes, I would like to start with a story about the tower in Gen 35, introducing the tower as a place where sheperds go to lamb their flock, and Jacob passing by.

4. I want to use paragraph 1, 3-4 and this: For now, though, the tower stood quietly, watching over the fields and the flocks, a silent witness to God‚Äôs unfolding plan. As Jacob and his family moved on, the shepherds returned to their work as the last sentence to this chapter, I don't want to reveal too much about the prophetic events too soon

5. The next scene shows the levitical shepherd preists tending to the flocks and specifically in one of the sheep's pens a lamb is being born and wrapped in swaddling cloths and placed in the manger, this would be 400 years before the birth of christ, and specify the lamb to be presented to the temple for the passover sacrifice.  Age sensitive

6. Can you provide illustrations for this as well?

7. back to the story, next chapter. At the tower, the shepherds experienced a hard summer that year and there was drought in the land affecting the ewes and the lambs that were being born had blemishes, spots.  It seemed that this year, they would not be able to use any of the lambs for the temple, thus the swaddling cloths continued to be hung up and not used

8. The season of hardship was the same year that a young couple traveled to Bethlehem for a census. With so many people coming to Bethlehem the couple arriving late was sure not to get a place to stay.  Rejected by the innkeeper, they had no where to go, she pregnant with child needed a warm place to have her baby.  They went back outside the city, and as if God was shining a beacon of light from the tower, they knew they were being drawn there.

9. Chapter headings should include scripture verses referencing the chapter, ie. Chapter 1 should be Gen 35, chapter 2 Micah 4:8, chapter 3 Micah 5:2, and so on.

10. Can you provide the scriptures in NASB2020 as a narration to each chapter

11. Now tell the rest of the story, with the shepherds, angels emphasis on the sign the angels speak of regarding the manger and cloths.

12. Can you provide another illustration of the tower, larger, with a pen and manger inside?  Also can you provide other illustrations for the other events in this book, and maybe a cover illustration and title

13. how about an illustration of the shepherds and angels

14. More shepherds and angels without wings

15. What would you title this story, can you provide a cover image with the title to be used for the front cover of the book

16. The tower needs to be humble very ancient looking

17. Can you include the title

18. change the font to more humble ancient

19. the tower needs to be more ancient, smaller more raggedly built with stones from the region of Bethal.  Also I think the title should be Migdal Eder, the birthplace of the Lamb

20. can I get that as an image like the others

21. Can you provide a psalm of "God watching over His Flock"

22. using the format of the .mdx file (Markdown) and my version of this story (The MigdalEder..pdf) review the Witness of the Pasture and the Flock.pdf rewrite the story with 4-12 year olds in mind, adding the stories listed in the witness pdf to it.  Also use artistic renditions of the real images of the tower of the flock

23. going back to the original mdx file I am replacing chapter 3 with the ruth and boaz story from the witness pdf

24. so lets go back to the original story we used, but instead of chapter 3 fill it with the ruth and boaz and king david in the perspective of the tower

25. the main emphasis is on the tower, its perspectives.  As it is a strong steadfast overseeing the events around it, providing comfort safety peace for the "flock" using the format and styling of the .mdx file, the contexts, content add the ingredient of Ruth and David, underlying the loss that both Ruth and Jacob did under the watchful sympathetic eye of the tower

26. can you rewrite this sentence, I want to represent the tower something that is strong and watchful loving as God the Father is to his creation:  It had watched over the sheep and shepherds for many years, standing strong as a silent reminder of God‚Äôs love and care for all of His creation. But the tower also saw the deep sadness of a man named Jacob.

27. the previous paragraph speaks of its stones, so it is repeative, can we creatively rewrite these 2 paragraphs expounding on the stones as something sturdy and strong representing an everlasting God strong:  Long ago, in the rolling hills of Canaan, a special tower stood tall above the fields. It was called *Migdal Eder* ‚Äî the Tower of the Flock. Built of sturdy stones, this watchtower was a shelter for shepherds and their flocks. At its base were pens where sheep could safely rest, and inside, shepherds carefully tended to the lambs, especially those born in the cool of night.  The tower stood steadfast, its ancient stones a testament to strength and watchfulness, offering shelter and peace to the flock below. It bore witness to the deep sorrow of Jacob, silently reflecting the compassionate care of God the Father for all His creation.

28. There was a historical tower called Migdal Eder, can you describe it to children and provide reflection of God's character with the tower for these 2 paragraphes

29. can you shorten these 2 paragraphs for a story telling to children

30. I want descriptive 1st paragraphs to impact the kids:   Long ago, in the rolling hills of Canaan, a special tower stood tall above the fields. It was called *Migdal Eder* ‚Äî the Tower of the Flock. Built of sturdy stones, this watchtower was a shelter for shepherds and their flocks. At its base were pens where sheep could safely rest, and inside, shepherds carefully tended to the lambs, especially those born in the cool of night.  It had a watchful eye over the sheep and shepherds that grazed and watered for generations keeping them safe from the wild animals, standing strong, a silent reminder of God‚Äôs love and care for all of His creation. But the tower also saw the deep sadness of a man named Jacob.

31. create an image of the tower on a hill, with young shepherds tending  sheep, and playful lambs

32. this is the finished product, is it too long to read to children for a Christmas story, maybe the first 6 chapters could be for the story then Chapter 7 and 8 can be used for the parents with scripture references as a bible study to confirm all the events were timed according to the scriptures.  if you need to refine the story provide it in chapter format and if you could write up a bible study for adults to do at the end.  Lastly, I want a separate page filled with the scripture reading for each of the chapters, so that it can be handed out to a narator

33. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-SQvvzPm1HQjwa1hu3gJDer", "size_bytes": 47484, "width": 468, "height": 145, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

34. Can you provide verses for this I have Ruth 2:10-12 but need something to talk of God's comfort and bringing them that are far off near to Him: Ruth and Boaz‚Äôs grandson, Jesse, would become the father of David, the shepherd who would one day become a king. Ruth‚Äôs story of loss and love reminded the tower of God‚Äôs promises to comfort and be close to His people, no matter where they are from.

35. In the old testament "The Lord said to my Lord"

37. As a creative children's book author, touch up this paragraph provide an anticipated climax:  The tower watched over all of this with quiet wonder. Every perfect lamb reminded the tower of something greater that was coming‚Äîa perfect Lamb who would one day save the whole world. The Migdal Eder knew its purpose was part of a bigger plan, and it waited for the day when the ultimate Lamb of God would be born under its watchful eye.

38. I need slight revision, "A Lamb who would not just save a flock, but the entire world". Can we say something instead of save a flock.. I guess this would be an analogy for the sins of the people of isreal

39. revision, "The Migdal Eder felt its purpose woven into a grand design". Something speaks to Migdal Eder as a Grand Designer

40. revision "The Migdal Eder stood as a reflection of the Grand Designer‚Äôs work, its every stone a testament to His eternal plan. As the winds whispered through its walls and the stars cast their gentle light upon it, the tower seemed to know it was part of something far greater" The Migdal Eder felt its purpose as if coming from a Grand Designer, who's  sunrises and gentle breezes speak "Just a little while longer

41. Is there a verse that speaks of levitical priests and spotless lambs for the sacrifice of passover

42. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-NUw8oG7PfsiSE6ap9qTmSN", "size_bytes": 61635, "width": 468, "height": 210, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

43. as that same writer: As the light faded and the angels disappeared, the shepherds stood in stunned silence. Then, with hearts bursting with wonder and joy, they hurried to the Tower of the Flock. There, in the humble manger, they found the newborn Messiah, just as the angel had said. Mary and Joseph welcomed them warmly, marveling at the story the shepherds shared.

45. With the same writer, help me finish the story of the tower of the flock  The shepherds knelt in worship before the child, knowing they were in the presence of the long-awaited Savior.  Leaving the tower, they went out into the night, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, and they told everyone they met about the miraculous events of that holy night.  The tower, standing tall and steadfast, marveled at the fulfillment of God‚Äôs promise. The Lamb of God had come, not just to be cared for by shepherds, but to save the whole world. The shepherds returned to their fields, glorifying and praising God for all they had seen and heard.

46. I like the last 2 paragraphs, Add Migdal meaning strong tower, in Nehemiah.  As well as John the baptist proclaiming Behold the Lamb of God.  Rewrite the first 2 paragraphs, shepherds proclaim the good news far and wide, as the tower standing tall and resiliant it's mission to protect the young family and provide its warmth from the cold

47. Is there a verse that has the "Strong Tower" in it

48. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-Nf3GwMxmqKfCobuyqLPDvS", "size_bytes": 219284, "width": 468, "height": 650, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

49. I don't want repeated content, can you review this and help as a creative childrens book writer: As the radiant light faded and the angels disappeared into the night, the shepherds stood frozen in stunned silence, their hearts pounding with awe. For a moment, the fields were quiet again. Then, with hearts bursting with wonder and joy, they sprang into motion, hurrying to the Tower of the Flock. Under the shadow of the ancient tower, in a humble manger filled with fresh straw, they found Him‚Äîthe newborn Messiah‚Äîjust as the angel had said. His tiny form lay wrapped in swaddling cloths. The shepherds, filled with unexplainable love and joy, went out into the night proclaiming the good news far and wide: ‚ÄúThe Savior has been born! We have seen Him‚Äîthe Lamb of God, lying in a manger!‚Äù Their voices echoed through the quiet hills, carrying the miraculous story to all who would hear. As they spread the news, the Tower of the Flock stood tall and resilient, its mission now is to protect and provide warmth to the young family on that sacred night, guarding them from the wild animals and the cold night. Migdal Eder, whose name means ‚Äústrong tower,‚Äù  The name of the Lord is a strong tower; The righteous runs into it and is safe. (Proverbs 18:10) The Tower of the Flock had not only sheltered lambs for sacrifice but now had witnessed the arrival of the Lamb of God, the winds gently stirred around its ancient stones, as if carrying the joyful news far and wide: the Savior had come. Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! (John 1:29) As the world began to stir with the dawn of a new day, the tower remained a steadfast symbol of God‚Äôs plan and promise, a reminder to all who passed by that the long-awaited Messiah had come. It stood watch as heaven‚Äôs light had touched the earth, silently proclaiming the faithfulness of the Grand Designer who had woven this moment into His eternal story. And so, the Tower of the Flock continued its quiet vigil, no longer just a shelter for lambs but a witness to the greatest story ever told‚Äîthe story of the Lamb who would save the world.

51. Add Glory to God in the highest verse: As dawn broke over the quiet hills, the tower stood steadfast, a silent witness to the fulfillment of God‚Äôs promises. Heaven‚Äôs light had touched the earth, and the Grand Designer‚Äôs eternal plan had unfolded before its watchful eye. And so, the Tower of the Flock continued its quiet vigil, no longer just a shelter for lambs but a testament to the greatest story ever told‚Äîthe story of the Lamb who would save the world. The tower‚Äôs story is really God‚Äôs story‚Äîa story of love, redemption, and joy. It reminds us that God uses even the smallest things‚Äîlike a manger, a shepherd boy, or a quiet tower‚Äîto show His glory.

56. How do I reorder pages in Word docx

57. Review this story's flow and scripture references, the flow seemed a little choppy and didn't end as dramatic as I had hoped.  As a creative children book writer can you revise the book so children of ages 6-12 would enjoy it.  The perspective should be from the Tower's point of view and it should have the characteristics of God the Father.  No word repetativeness

58. Lets begin again with Chapter 1, Introduction of the Ancient Tower of the Flock, "Before Jacob, I was there" What did the tower do, also reference Rachel's Ben-Oni name with scripture.

It was called Migdal Eder‚Äîthe Tower of the Flock. The Tower had watched over shepherds and their flocks for generations, offering shelter during storms and safety from prowling beasts. Built with care and strength, it stood as a symbol of stability and protection, its presence a quiet reminder of the Creator‚Äôs unchanging faithfulness. Beneath its shadow, lambs were born, shepherds sang their songs, and life flourished. The Tower was not just a place of refuge; it bore witness to history. It stood firm through times of joy and sorrow, carrying the stories of those who passed beneath its watchful gaze. Each sunrise over its stones seemed to whisper of promises yet to be fulfilled, and every breeze carried the hope of something far greater to come.

76. This is what I am going with: Long ago stood an ancient tower, its polished stones sculpted by the wind and rain, were steady and solid, crafted by some Grand Designer. It seemed timeless, always there watching over the fields. For generations it had been used for shepherds and their sheep, offering refuge from raging storms and protection from wild animals. This protective tower became known as Migdal Eder or the Tower of the Flock.

78. I want to use these words"a silent testament" or "testamony", beacon, and Grand Designer to picture the lambs first breath.  But I need to convey something more about the Grand designer, gentle but strong, creation with care, other words to describe creation of the tower and its unmoveable character: Over the years it stood as a beacon of strength and safety, a silent testament to the Grand Designer‚Äôs enduring faithfulness. Beneath its steady presence, lambs took their first breaths, shepherds lifted their voices in songs of praise, and the fields thrived under its care.

79. I want to reword this: Grand Designer‚Äôs enduring faithfulness and intricate care. Each stone seemed purposefully placed by hands both gentle and mighty, crafted with the same precision and love as the fields it overlooked. Beneath its steady presence  Grand designers enduring patience as He took great care to purposefully placed each stone.. Beneath its majestic and humble? presence

83. Chapter 1: Before Jacob, I am Long ago stood an ancient tower, its polished stones sculpted by the wind and rain, were steady and solid, crafted by some Grand Designer. It seemed timeless, always there watching over the fields. For generations it had been used for shepherds and their sheep, offering refuge from raging storms and protection from wild animals. This protective tower became known as Migdal Eder or the Tower of the Flock.  Over the years, the tower stood as a beacon of unwavering strength and steadfast protection, a silent testament to the Grand Designer, it spoke of enduring patience and great care. Each stone was purposefully placed, crafted with intention and love, reflecting the wisdom and strength of its Creator.   Beneath its majestic yet humble presence, lambs drew their first breaths, shepherds lifted their voices in songs of praise, and creation flourished under its watchful care.  More than a sanctuary, the Tower was a witness to the passing of time. It stood unmoved through seasons of laughter and weeping, holding within its stones the echoes of countless stories. Each new dawn painted its walls with light, with every gentle breeze seemed to whisper of a greater purpose yet to unfold.

86. Can I combine: Long ago, in the rolling hills of Canaan, there stood a special tower called Migdal Eder, which means ‚ÄúTower of the Flock.‚Äù The tower was made of strong, rugged stones, each perfectly placed carefully crafted by the Grand Designer, reaching high above the green fields. The shepherds loved this tower because it was their shelter‚Äîa place where they could watch over their sheep and keep them safe. At the base of the tower, the sheep rested peacefully in pens, while inside, shepherds cared for newborn lambs, gently wrapping them in soft cloths to protect them during the cool nights.  With  A silent testament to the Grand Designer, it spoke of His enduring patience and great care. Every stone was purposefully placed, crafted with intention and love, reflecting the wisdom and strength of its Creator

96. Besides Exodus 12 is there some scripture that talks about the passover lamb to reference the story in this section? As the lambs were born, the shepherd priests carefully checked them. If a lamb was perfect, they wrapped it in soft cloths to keep it safe and clean. Then they laid the lamb in a stone manger, where it could rest quietly. These perfect lambs were very special. When they were old enough, the priests would carry them to Jerusalem, through the Lamb‚Äôs Gate, to be offered as sacrifices during Passover.

100. Chapter 3 The Anointed and Awaited King, can we tell more of the story, at the end how David would allocate the fields and the tower to the special work of the Levite shepherds to prepare the passover lambs -- here is what we have so it can be expanded a little bit: The fields near the Migdal Eder were peaceful as a young shepherd named David tended his father‚Äôs sheep. The tower had seen David many times, singing songs to God as he cared for the flock. But one day, something very special happened.  The prophet Samuel came to visit David‚Äôs family. God had sent Samuel to anoint the next king of Israel, and to everyone‚Äôs surprise, God chose David, the youngest brother. The tower watched as Samuel poured oil over David‚Äôs head, marking him as the future king. The Spirit of the Lord led David, and the tower could almost feel the excitement of what was to come.  David would grow up to be a great king, but he never forgot the fields where he had cared for his sheep. The tower stood tall, always vigilant, having witnessed the beginning of David‚Äôs incredible journey as the man after God‚Äôs own heart.

106. Need help with Chapter 4: Many years later, the fields of Bethlehem Ephrathah (which means ‚Äúplace where Rachel died) were no longer ordinary. The shepherds who cared for these flocks were not just regular shepherds‚Äîthey were priests, trusted with a very important job. The tower stood tall, always vigilant, as it watched over this special work. It had once witnessed the humble beginnings of David‚Äôs incredible journey, and now it observed a legacy of worship and sacrifice being established in the same fields. Under its watchful presence, lambs were carefully tended, wrapped in soft cloths, and laid in stone mangers, waiting for the day they would be carried to Jerusalem through the Lamb‚Äôs Gate, to be offered at the Temple during Passover. The Migdal Eder, the Tower of the Flock, watched as the shepherd priests did their work. When a ewe was about to have a baby lamb, the shepherds would gently guide her into a clean room at the base of the tower. This room was kept spotless because the lambs born there had to be perfect‚Äîwithout any spots, blemishes, or injuries. These lambs would one day be used for sacrifices to bring the people closer to God.  As the lambs were born, the shepherd priests carefully checked them. If a lamb was perfect, they wrapped it in soft cloths to keep it safe and clean. Then they laid the lamb in a stone manger, where it could rest quietly. These perfect lambs were very special. When they were old enough, the priests would carry them to Jerusalem, through the Lamb‚Äôs Gate, to be offered as sacrifices during Passover.

109. I have about 2 to 3 sentences to the page I want to fill it more, This is about the journey to Bethlehem, maybe mention the couple seeing the tower on their way to the town?  This is what we have so far just for the journey: The roads leading to Bethlehem were busy with travelers. The Roman Emperor had ordered a census, and families from far and wide returned to their ancestral towns to be registered. Among these travelers was a young couple from Nazareth. The man, Joseph, led the way, guiding their donkey over the dusty paths. His wife, Mary, sat quietly on the animal‚Äôs back, her face glowing with the gentle anticipation of motherhood. She was carrying a child‚Äîa child whose arrival had been foretold by an angel.

111. This next section is after they see the Tower and head to it.  Can you use the same number of words and tweak these paragraphs.  Should be the same size and format As Mary gave birth to her son in the quiet shelter of the Tower of the Flock, the fields outside Bethlehem were alive with the soft rustling of sheep and the low murmur of shepherds keeping watch. Suddenly, the sky above the fields was filled with radiant light, and an angel of the Lord appeared. The shepherds shielded their eyes, trembling in fear as the glory of the Lord surrounded them.    The angel spoke gently, calming their fears: ‚ÄúDo not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people. For today in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.‚Äù The shepherds listened in awe as the angel continued: ‚ÄúThis will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.‚Äù

113. I would like this chapter to be as climatic as the event that transpires, can you preview this chapter and write it keeping about the same length: The significance of the sign was not lost on these shepherds. They knew the Tower of the Flock, the place where lambs destined for sacrifice were born and wrapped in swaddling cloths. The angel‚Äôs message was clear: this child was no ordinary baby. He was the Savior, the Lamb of God, who would take away the sins of the world.    Suddenly, a multitude of heavenly hosts began to appear, praising God and saying, ‚ÄúGlory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among people with whom He is pleased.‚Äù  As the radiant light faded and the angels disappeared into the night, the shepherds stood frozen in stunned silence, their hearts pounding with awe. For a moment, the fields were still, as if the heavens themselves paused to savor the wonder of what had been proclaimed. Then, with hearts bursting with joy, the shepherds sprang into motion, hurrying to the Tower of the Flock.   Under the shadow of the ancient tower, they found Him‚Äîthe newborn Messiah‚Äîjust as the angel had said. In a humble manger filled with fresh straw, the tiny form of the Savior lay wrapped in swaddling cloths. The shepherds knelt in worship, overwhelmed by unexplainable love and joy, knowing they were in the presence of the long-awaited Lamb of God.  With wonder still in their hearts, the shepherds left the tower, proclaiming the good news far and wide: ‚ÄúThe Savior has been born! We have seen Him‚Äîthe Lamb of God, lying in a manger!‚Äù Their voices echoed through the quiet hills, carrying the miraculous story to all who would hear.

114. I finished that chapter with "Tears filled their eyes as they gazed at the child. This was the moment they had unknowingly awaited their entire lives‚Äîthe moment when heaven touched earth. " I couldn't finish it with the last paragraph.  I move on to Chapter 7 Migdal Eder the tower of the flock

115. For this chapter, I want to convey and emphasize that the tower was ancient, the builder unknown as if God Himself built it.  Stones placed perfectly, a testimony of the Creator's perfect plan from before time began.  The tower was to fulfill a perfect plan to bring the Passover Lamb into the world, spotless, perfect without sin.  Also Proverbs 18:10 mention Migdal means strong.  This will be the ending chapter so it has to close very well

116. Can you render an image of what Migdal Eder looks like today and include the location

117. Can you make an image of one of them as listed, like the 3rd image Artist rendition of it

118. Can the image have a brighter sunrise

122. Ok for Chapter 8 this is more of an explaination of what the sheep represent, and why the Tower was the place Jesus was to be born.  I want to overemphasize that God planned this from the beginning before time began, to perfectly lay out His plan to save His people from their sins.  I want to explain this story the shadows and the imagery to children, even the birth time was predetermined to coencide with the feast of the tabernacle:  Chapter 8: The Shadow, the Image, and the Light (For Children, optional read)  THE TOWER OF THE FLOCK EXPLAINED  A long time ago, God showed His love for His people through shadows‚Äîspecial stories and events that gave a picture of something wonderful He was planning. Think of it like when you see a shadow of someone coming around the corner. You can tell someone is there, even though you can‚Äôt see them yet. The shadow gives you a clue of what‚Äôs coming. The stories in the Bible, like the lambs at the Tower of the Flock, were shadows that gave clues about Jesus, God‚Äôs perfect Lamb, who was coming to save the world. The Migdal Eder, or Tower of the Flock, was one of those places where these shadows could be seen. It was a special place where lambs were born, carefully wrapped in soft cloths, and kept safe until they could be brought to Jerusalem for a very important sacrifice.  But these lambs were not the final gift. They were just a picture of something much greater‚ÄîGod‚Äôs perfect Lamb, Jesus.  Jesus‚Äô birth happened at a very special time of year‚Äîthe Feast of Booths, or Tabernacles. During this festival, families built small huts out of branches and leaves and lived in them for a whole week to remember how God cared for the Israelites in the wilderness. It was like a big camping trip with a special message: God is always with us. When Jesus was born during this time, it was as if God was saying, ‚ÄúNow I have come to live with you in person!‚Äù His birth was perfect in every way‚Äîeven the timing‚Äî showing that God‚Äôs love is always with us.  As Jesus grew up, He showed the world what God‚Äôs love looks like. When He rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, it was like the lambs that were brought through the Lamb‚Äôs Gate for Passover. And when Jesus gave His life on the cross, He became the ultimate sacrifice, just like the lambs from the Migdal Eder. He took away the sins of the world so that everyone who believes in Him could be close to God.  God planned every little detail, from the way Jesus was born to the time of His birth. Everything showed how perfect and loving His plan is. The shadows‚Äîlike the lambs at the Migdal Eder‚Äîhelped people recognize Jesus when He arrived. And when Jesus was born, those shadows became real.  Jesus is the Light of the World. He is the Lamb of God. He is the reason we can know God and be close to Him.

123. I would like to change the title of the book to title "The Tower of the Flock" subtitle "The original Christmas Story" Written by Dave Haines. Can you create a creative image for this, convey the sunrise shining on the Tower, shepherds, sheep and the tiny town of Bethlehem in the background and Joseph and Mary heading to the tower

124. The Tower needs to be ancient looking not so emboding, more as Jesus would become, no one regarded Him

125. Less perfect structure, more built into the landscape

126. Draw it so children would be drawn to the likable tower and sheep, for a kids book

127. Less child like and more like it was built into the hill and stones were built on top of the hill for the tower

129. More like this format, please include Mary Joseph and the donkey, can you add the title subtitle and written by

130. I don't see Mary on the donkey with Joseph, bring the tower closer and not so structured

131. Also the title and writing is not there, Joseph is not there no shepherds. and the tower looks ugly

132. The attached story is choppy, the tower description is repetitive, and it doesn't flow right for a childrens book.  I need the images on the and some of the scriptures in the left page, and the story on the right page.  I need each set of reading pages to have that format, can you rewrite the story so it flows, emphasizing the tower with the attributes of God, and God's perfect plan.  create a Word document

133. provide the content here

134. For chapter 1 can you just introduce the tower and write about Jacob's story

135. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-2f7wsJ31GwJxE28diuiLbN", "size_bytes": 64609, "width": 468, "height": 353, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

136. For chapter 2 mention a kinsman redeemer and provide a verse for that, also this version is better that what you provided: Years passed, and the tower continued to watch over the fields. One day, it noticed a woman named Ruth working hard to gather grain. Ruth was not from Bethlehem; she was from Moab. But she had chosen to stay with her mother-in-law, Naomi, after losing her husband. Ruth‚Äôs kindness and loyalty shone brightly, even in her sadness.  As Ruth worked, the tower saw a man named Boaz, the owner of the fields, take notice of her. Boaz was kind and generous, making sure Ruth had enough grain to take home. The tower watched as their friendship grew, and eventually, Boaz became Ruth‚Äôs kinsman redeemer. He married her and gave her a new beginning.

137. What verse describes a kinsman redeemer

138. Can you print out Lev 25:24

139. vs 25 in ESV

140. IS there a verse that describes Jesus as our kinsman redeemer, also kind of incorporate that into the chapter, an introduction to Boaz and Ruth's decendent

141. The tower kept the thought in mind about the kinsman redeemer, ... many years later the tower would look back on this moment and remember that their decendent became their redeemer

142. Just as boaz was ruth and naomi kinsman redeemer one born from them will be their ultimate redeemer

144. Years passed, and the tower continued to watch over the fields. One day, it noticed a woman named Ruth working hard to gather grain. Ruth was not from Bethlehem; she was from Moab. But she had chosen to stay with her mother-in-law, Naomi, after losing her husband. Ruth‚Äôs kindness and loyalty shone brightly, even in her sadness.   As Ruth worked, the tower saw a man named Boaz, the owner of the fields, take notice of her. Boaz was kind and generous, making sure Ruth had enough grain to take home. The tower watched as their friendship grew, and eventually, Boaz became Ruth‚Äôs kinsman redeemer. A kinsman redeemer was someone who rescued and cared for family members in need. He married her and gave her a new beginning.  " But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. Just as Boaz was Ruth and Naomi‚Äôs kinsman redeemer, one born from their family line would become the ultimate Redeemer‚Äînot just for their family, but for the whole world.   The tower, standing steadfast through the years, was part of God‚Äôs perfect plan to bring the Redeemer into the world. It would watch as that plan unfolded, knowing that the greatest act of redemption was yet to come.

I revised chapter 1 but the last paragraph needs a little more creativity, here is what I have for the other 2 paragraphs, help clean them up: Long ago, in the quiet hills of a region called Canaan (provide geographic location modern day), there was a special tower called Migdal Eder, which means ‚ÄúThe Tower of the Flock.‚Äù Built from strong stones perfectly placed as if a master architect had carefully placed each one, it had weathered my storms ever attacking it, trying to shake it from its solid rock foundation. This tower was ancient itself, as if when the world was created it too was placed there as an everlasting presence providing shelter and safety from prowling animals and fierce storms, for shepherds and their flock.  One day, Jacob, the grandson of Abraham, pitched a tent beyond the tower.. He was sad, for his beloved wife, Rachel, had just passed away after giving birth to a baby boy. In her last breath, Rachel named him Ben-Oni, which means ‚Äúson of my sorrow‚Äù (Genesis 35:18, ESV). But Jacob, though heartbroken, gave him a new name‚ÄîBenjamin, meaning ‚Äúson of my right hand‚Äù.  The tower stood silently as if sharing Jacob‚Äôs sorrow. It watched as Jacob buried Rachel near Bethlehem and set up a memorial stone for her. Even in this sad moment, God was working out His perfect plan‚Äîa plan that would one day bring great joy to the world. And though Jacob couldn‚Äôt see it yet, this same tower would stand witness to another birth, many years later, that would change everything.

151. can you help with my revisions of the 1st 2 paragraphs

152. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-2HiVtZXPBYrV77hb32nd6t", "size_bytes": 21023, "width": 468, "height": 106, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

153. I want to end this chapter with this, please polish it up, is it a good ending to this chapter?  Jacob took one last look at the tower, he spent several moments reflecting on the memories of Rachel, a warm breeze gently enveloped Jacob as if the tower was wrapping him in a blanket of love and tender mercy.  He journeyed on from the tower but was ever changed by that moment

154. Lets continue with the Chapter 2

155. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-TULrdpAnZXrHPiWW2LwBku", "size_bytes": 96239, "width": 468, "height": 464, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

156. trying to provide more creativity to this section:  Years passed, and one day, the tower noticed a woman named Ruth working hard in the fields, gathering leftover grain after the harvest. Ruth wasn‚Äôt from Bethlehem; she had come from a faraway place called Moab. Yet she had chosen to stay with her mother-in-law, Naomi, after losing her husband. Despite her sorrow, Ruth‚Äôs kindness and loyalty shone brightly as she cared for Naomi.  She would come to the fields that were under the tower, to pluck the grains from their stems, she was not afraid because she felt safe under the watchful eye of the tower. One day the owner of the fields came by to meet Ruth, Boaz was a kind and generous man, and he made sure Ruth had plenty of grain to take home. Day by day, the tower saw their friendship grow, and eventually, Boaz became Ruth‚Äôs kinsman redeemer‚Äîthe one who would rescue and care for her family. He married Ruth, giving her a new beginning and restoring hope to her and Naomi.  Just as Boaz was Ruth‚Äôs kinsman redeemer, one born from their family line would become the ultimate Redeemer‚Äînot just for their family, but for the whole world.   From the family of Ruth and Boaz came a son, and then a grandson, named Jesse. And from Jesse‚Äôs family came a young shepherd boy named David‚Äîone day to be king. Many generations later, another child would be born in these very fields, a child who would be called the Lamb of God, sent to redeem the world.

157. Is there anywhere else in the bible that talks about the "Kinsman Redeemer"

158. yes Isaiah and Galatians

159. Lets go on to Chapter 3 David the anointed king

160. Chapter 5 about the levitical shepherds

161. this chapter is repetitive in the account with the shepherds and their duties, also the tower description is repetative

162. Lets go to Chapter 6

163. oops my bad, should have been chapter 5.  the journey to bethlehem

164. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-NifqaYU3PcwBvLrXwhkWPz", "size_bytes": 11194, "width": 468, "height": 42, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

165. The tower was ancient, and its very presence seemed to whisper that the Master Creator was about to reveal His ultimate creation. Maybe Grand Designer is to reveal His .. Archtecture, construction.  Help me out

167. The roads leading to Bethlehem were bustling with travelers. The Roman Emperor had ordered a census, and families from far and wide returned to their ancestral towns to be registered. Among the many travelers was a young couple from Nazareth‚ÄîJoseph, a carpenter, and Mary, his wife, who was expecting a very special child.  As they made their way along the dusty paths, the fields of Bethlehem Ephrathah stretched out before them. The sun hung low in the sky, casting golden light across the rolling hills. Mary sat quietly on the back of a donkey, her hands resting gently on her belly, while Joseph walked beside her, guiding their way with care. He glanced at Mary often, concern etched on his face, for the time for her to give birth was drawing near.  As the couple drew closer to Bethlehem, they passed fields where shepherds tended their sheep. Mary noticed the peaceful scene and felt a sense of calm. She couldn‚Äôt help but think of the stories Joseph had told her‚Äîstories of how this very land had seen God‚Äôs faithfulness through the generations. She thought of Ruth, who had gathered grain in these fields long ago, and of David, the shepherd boy who had become a king.  Joseph looked toward the tower, it looked ancient, built from strong, weathered stones, it stood humbly atop a hill, blending into the landscape as if it had always been there. He didn‚Äôt know why, but something about the sight of it filled him with hope. He squeezed Mary‚Äôs hand gently, offering silent reassurance. They had come so far, and though the journey had been long and difficult, he trusted that God was leading them.  As night began to fall, the lights of Bethlehem flickered in the distance, welcoming the weary travelers. They pressed on toward the town, unaware that soon, they would find shelter not in an inn, but in the very fields they had passed‚Äîunder the shadow of the ancient tower.

168. Chapters 5 cont, 6 and 7 of the original story starts to become awkward, and doesn't flow.  You are doing very well so far so if you have to make the story flow by all means do so, so the ending is a grand ending.

169. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-Py5SGGdgBBrduoZx7CaD7D", "size_bytes": 24804, "width": 468, "height": 106, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

170. Can you add some texture, content of the bustling town to this paragraph:  The weary couple finally arrived in Bethlehem, only to find the town crowded with travelers. Every inn was full, and there was no place for them to stay. Joseph grew anxious as he searched for shelter, but nothing was available. Mary, sensing his concern, reassured him with a gentle smile. She trusted that God would provide, even in this moment of uncertainty.

171. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-Ctpc8jtTHtnSVcGsimbzCB", "size_bytes": 49929, "width": 468, "height": 211, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

172. please help polish this paragraph: With no other choice, they left busy Bethlehem and ventured in the cold dark night. As they moved away from the bustling town, Joseph noticed the familiar shape of the Tower of the Flock, silhouetted against the night sky. Light spilled out from it as if beconing the young couple to come and take shelter in it‚Äôs warm and loving care. Though it was just a simple shelter, Joseph led Mary toward the tower, trusting that it would offer them protection and peace. Inside, the air was still. The stone walls provided refuge from the cool night air, and fresh straw lay scattered across the floor. It wasn‚Äôt a grand palace, but it was enough‚Äîa humble place for a humble birth.

173. another word for weary

174. another word for weary

175. how about an elegant word for grateful

176. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-GHwpU3ohBqLB6bj2YNj8VT", "size_bytes": 92357, "width": 468, "height": 528, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

177. Can you provide more descriptive words about the brilliance of the light in this chapter, and help me with the wording so far:  Outside the Tower in the fields near Bethlehem, the Levitical shepherd priests were tending their flocks. They were ordinary men and despised by everyone. Being a shepherd was considered low class and no one liked them, but the sheep they watched over were not. These were the special sheep‚Äîlambs destined for sacrifice at the Temple in Jerusalem.   Suddenly, the quiet night was interrupted by a brilliant light. The shepherds shielded their eyes in fear as an angel of the Lord appeared before them. The glory of the Lord surrounded them, and they trembled at the sight.  ‚ÄúDo not be afraid,‚Äù the angel said gently. ‚ÄúI bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. Today, in the city of David, a Savior has been born for you. He is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.‚Äù  Before the shepherds could respond, the sky was filled with a multitude of angels, all praising God and saying,  ‚ÄúGlory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom He is pleased!‚Äù  As suddenly as they had appeared, the angels departed, leaving the fields in stillness once more. The shepherds stood in awe, their hearts racing with wonder and joy. Without hesitation, they gathered their things and hurried toward the Tower of the Flock, eager to see the child the angel had spoken of.

178. Chapter 6 Or in my case Chapter 7, Good News and Glad tidings, I need more emphasize on the Sign and the shepherds knowing where the baby lay, the swaddling cloths only used for the spotless perfect lambs and the connection to the baby

179. Dont repeat what is been told in Chapter 4 levitical priests.  We know that already

180. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-6SfDHBCHjfdCKEJkrNE8Bm", "size_bytes": 120165, "width": 468, "height": 591, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

181. this is what I have so far, can add to the ending of the chapter: Outside the Tower, in the fields near Bethlehem, the Levitical shepherd priests were tending their flocks. They were humble men, often overlooked and despised by society. Though being a shepherd was considered a lowly job, the sheep they watched over were anything but ordinary. These were the sacred lambs, carefully raised for sacrifice at the Temple in Jerusalem.  Suddenly, the quiet night was shattered by a radiant brilliance, unlike anything the shepherds had ever seen. The dark sky blazed with light, illuminating the fields in a shimmering glow. The shepherds shielded their eyes, trembling with fear, as an angel of the Lord appeared before them. The air seemed to hum with the presence of God‚Äôs glory, wrapping around them like a blinding, golden fire.  ‚ÄúDo not be afraid,‚Äù the angel said gently, his voice calm and steady. ‚ÄúI bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. Today, in the city of David, a Savior has been born for you. He is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.‚Äù  Before the shepherds could speak, the sky above them erupted into dazzling splendor as a multitude of angels appeared. Their voices soared in perfect harmony, filling the night with glorious praise:  ‚ÄúGlory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom He is pleased!‚Äù  As suddenly as they had appeared, the angels vanished, leaving behind a deep stillness. The fields, once lit by heavenly radiance, were now cloaked in quiet darkness again. The shepherds stood frozen in awe, their hearts pounding with a mixture of wonder and joy. Without hesitation, they gathered their things and hurried toward the Tower of the Flock, eager to see the child the angel had spoken of.

182. Do we want to end the story here or should we explain what the tower meant and what the events it saw meant as well in the last chapter

183. yes

184. this is the completed story text.  Can you review it, and if it flows and explains the purpose the tower represents that God has a perfect plan and every "stone" was laid perfectly, each stone fitting perfectly.  Tower represents God Himself ancient, steadfast, strong, yet loving caring, watchful.  Also each chapter is a foreshadow of Jesus the ultimate redeemer of His people

185. yes please provide all the help I could use

186. I like Chapter 1 from my attachment, more softly spoken and descriptions of the tower were soft and not mechanical

187. I like Chapter 2 from the attachment better, It mentions the ultimate redeemer but lets the audience fill in the gap about Jesus

188. Lets try chapter 3

189. I like the attached file Chapter 3, lets try chapter 4

190. I really like the Attached Chapter 4, This one is still too mechanical, no emotion

191. I think Chapter 5 I cut some text from it to shorten it to one page, so I might want to just add what was lost from this session, so if you can modify it only and include the lost text

192. I don't think you added anything to my attached chapter 5, but lets try Chapter 6, maybe you can just edit chapter 6 (attached), but also keep in mind we are trying to acheive an ending

193. Can you provide an outline to this story, break down each chapter

194. I want a whole chapter 6 the story of the couple in bethlehem and going to the tower

195. Ok can you create the outline from the attachment

196. Can you create an outline from this pdf?  Also I will need help with the final 3 chapters

197. Yes, lets see if you can help with Chapter 7

198. I will have to edit this chapter but we can move on to Chapter 8 and9

199. Chapter 9 describe the tower perfectly placed stones represented every story that played out under its watchful eye, just as the stones were perfectly placed, God's plan of redemption is also played out perfectly like the stones

200. Can you regenerate that chapter, It is close but maybe with the same tone, emotion

201. Ok for chapter 2 I want to do a scripture reading for the kinsman redeemer for a church service, can you provide a scripture reading manuscript that I can read at church

202. I want to read the chapter from the book, but I also want to read scripture that references Jesus as the kinsman redeemer, especially Him being a direct descendent to Boaz and Ruth, or Joseph and Mary descendents

203. Boaz represents Jesus in His first coming as David represents Jesus in His second coming, can you provide a closing reflection statement that I can use with that in mind, I emphasize on the kinsman redeemer

204. The story of Boaz and Ruth I should focus on His first coming, with just a mention of the second coming represented by David.  I would like to include the tower in this reflection because Jesus will be the perfect lamb to redeem, and if there is scripture to go with

205. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-BCAk6ZR9bN4kMiakqWFCFo", "size_bytes": 29970, "width": 468, "height": 197, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

206. I plan to use the following: Boaz, Ruth‚Äôs and Naomi‚Äôs kinsman redeemer, stepped in to restore her family and give her a new beginning. In the same way, Jesus came to redeem us, stepping into our brokenness and offering us new life through His sacrifice. The fields where Boaz and Ruth‚Äôs story unfolded near Bethlehem were later the very fields where shepherds would watch over the lambs destined for Temple sacrifice. And it was in those same fields, under the shadow of the Tower of the Flock, that the ultimate Lamb‚ÄîJesus‚Äîwas born.  I don't want to describe our condition as brokeness, because we are spiritually dead.  Also Ruth represents the Church and Naomi represents Israel.  Can this paragraph be rewritten to include these

207. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-SFJ6KLEPC2DEA9peYY2tfN", "size_bytes": 40318, "width": 468, "height": 246, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

208. I cut this up a little, does it still flow right? Boaz, as Ruth‚Äôs and Naomi‚Äôs kinsman redeemer, stepped in to restore Ruth‚Äôs life and give her a new beginning, while also bringing hope back to Naomi. In the same way, Jesus came as our ultimate Kinsman Redeemer‚Äînot just to mend what was broken, but to give life. Together, their story is a beautiful picture of God‚Äôs plan of redemption. The fields where Boaz and Ruth‚Äôs story unfolded near Bethlehem were later the very fields where shepherds would watch over lambs destined for sacrifice at the Temple. And it was in those same fields, under the shadow of the Tower of the Flock, that the ultimate Lamb‚ÄîJesus‚Äîwas born, the One who would redeem not just a single family, but all who would trust in Him.

209. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-M9W1W8XGcngDHA69WcjqgM", "size_bytes": 22798, "width": 468, "height": 148, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

210. This paragraph needs to be rewritten, "One day Tower notices david" Was he doing something differnt? "The Tower had seen david many times before"  The fields near Migdal Eder were peaceful as the Tower continued its watch over the rolling hills of Bethlehem. Shepherds still tended their sheep beneath its shadow, just as they had for generations. One day, the tower noticed a young shepherd boy named David caring for his father‚Äôs flock. The Tower had seen David many times before‚Äîsinging songs to God as he watched over the sheep, protecting them from wild animals, and showing great courage and care for the flock.

212. Chapter 7, is a little much on the description, can you provide more action and less vivid imagery?  Outside the Tower, in the fields near Bethlehem, the Levitical shepherd priests were tending their flocks. They were humble men, often overlooked and despised by society. Though being a shepherd was considered a lowly job, the sheep they watched over were anything but ordinary.  Suddenly, the quiet night was shattered by a radiant brilliance, unlike anything the shepherds had ever seen. The dark sky blazed with light, illuminating the fields in a shimmering glow. The shepherds shielded their eyes, trembling with fear, as an angel of the Lord appeared before them. The air seemed to hum with the presence of God‚Äôs glory, wrapping around them like a blinding, golden fire.  ‚ÄúDo not be afraid,‚Äù the angel said gently, his voice calm and steady. ‚ÄúI bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.

And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.‚Äù  Before the shepherds could speak, the sky above them erupted into dazzling splendor as a multitude of angels appeared. Their voices soared in perfect harmony, filling the night with glorious praise: ‚ÄúGlory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom He is pleased!‚Äù As suddenly as they had appeared, the angels vanished, leaving behind a deep stillness. The fields, once lit by heavenly radiance, were now cloaked in quiet darkness again. The shepherds stood frozen in awe.

1. please define prevenient grace, use scripture references

2. I am writing a bible study on Galatians 1:3-4, 1:6-9. A different Gospel.  I want the file formatted in markdown but not in a code window.  I want a table of contents, appropriate headers, scripture references in blockquote and em. the file is just in note format capturing all that I want to read and include.  Can you create a bible study where I lead it and assign scripture references to the group

3. hmm.. the central theme listed is the true gospel coming from granted repentance and grace through faith.  This should be the central theme of the study

4. Ok, can you just clean up my .md formatting to the request I started with?

5. --- title: "The Book of Galatians" date: 2024-12-15 author: "Dave Haines" excerpt: "In short, the Gospel is the message of salvation, the good news that men may be forgiven of their sins and reconciled to God" image: "/images/welcome.jpg" ---  # Table of Content 1. [Interpretation](#interpretation) 2. [Galatians Chapter 1](#galatians-chapter-1) 3. [Key Supporting Scripture](#key-supporting-scripture) 4. [Prevenient Grace](#prevenient-grace)   ## Galatians Theme **The main theme is Christian Liberty, doctrine of Justification by Faith.  Jesus Christ has set us free. Defending against Legalism**  # Galatians Chapter 1  **Introduction**    vs.1 *"Paul, an apostle (not sent from men nor through human agency, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead),"* vs.2 *"and all the brothers who are with me,"*   *"To the churches of Galatia:"*     vs.3 *"Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,"* vs.4 *"who gave Himself for our sins so that He might rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,"* vs.5 *"to whom be the glory forevermore. Amen."*    **vs. 3-4 Grace Peace Will** > Grace = God's unmerited favor and blessing, In the context of the New Testament, it often denotes God's gracious gift of salvation and His continued favor and blessing on believers. > Peace = In the New Testament, "eirƒìnƒì" often describes the peace that comes from God, reconciling believers to Himself through Christ and fostering harmonious relationships among His people.  We were saved by grace, (God‚Äôs unmerited favor), and that grace gave us peace with God, and that grace came as a matter of the will of God.  - Salvation is a matter of God‚Äôs grace alone and nothing else - If someone claims that any work is required for salvation, they have changed the message and distorted the gospel - Men receive grace, men receive peace, men receive salvation   - Men do not earn it   - Men do not retain it   - Men do not even ask for it  **vs.4 Rescue from this present evil age** - When we receive the Gospel, we are born again that spiritual change separates us from the sin of the world   - We are set apart from that evil even as we live around it - Secondly, we are set apart in our future destiny   - We are rescued from the judgment this world will experience, We will not share in that fate  Now notice, if God‚Äôs grace has rescued us from the world around us and from the judgment to come, then what more is required than grace? - The Gospel of grace grants us everything we need for our life both now and to come, It is the source of our sanctification and justification. Nothing else is required.   **Distortion of the Gospel**    vs.6 *"I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel,"* vs.7 *"which is not just another account; but there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ."* vs.8 *"But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed!"* vs.9 *"As we have said before, even now I say again: if anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, he is to be accursed!"*    **vs.6 Deserting Him** Notice Paul says the church is deserting Christ - Paul will speak in these terms at several points in this letter - To abandon the Gospel is to abandon Christ - They are abandoning the One Who called them by grace  **vs.6 A different Gospel** - Is there such a thing as a diffrent gospel, gospel means glad tidings, good news. Any other gospel is not a gospel at all. - Shouldn‚Äôt every Christian be able to explain the Gospel easily?  ### The Gospel **In short, the Gospel is the message of salvation, the good news that men may be forgiven of their sins and be reconciled to God** - It is a message centered on the Person and work of Jesus Christ   #### First, the Gospel message begins with repentance from dead works > 2Cor. 7:10 *"For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret, leading to salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces death."*  #### Repentence 1. Repentence is granted by God: **Read Romans 1:26-2:6**   - In the same context it was shown that Esau was not granted repentence even as he sought it with tears > Heb 12:16-17 *"See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many become defiled; 16that there be no sexually immoral or godless person like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a single meal. 17For you know that even afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought for it with tears."*  2. Process of Repentence Once we have been "granted" repentence, we recognize we are sinners in need of forgiveness:   **Read Psalm 51** - Recognition of Sin (*Psalm 51:3*) - Godly Sorrow and Brokenness (*Psalm 51:4*) - Pleading for God's Mercy (*Psalm 51:1*) - Confession and Cleansing (*Psalm 51:2*) - Desire for a new heart (*Psalm 51:10*) - Restoration and Commitment (*Psalm 51:12-13*) - Offering a broken and contrite heart (*Psalm 51:17*)  #### Secondly, the Gospel proclaims we are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ! - **We believe and confess** Jesus is Lord, that He died to pay the debt for our sin - **We Hope in** His resurrection that demonstrated His power over death, our hope is continually that if He was resurrected, and we are in Him that we too shall be resurrected delivered from death and Hades.  1. Process of Salvation **Read Ephesians 1:1-2:9, Romans 8-9**      [Table of Content](#table-of-content)  # Key Supporting Scripture - 2 Tim. 2:24-26The Lord‚Äôs bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, skillful in teaching, patient when wronged, 25with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth, 26and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.  - 2 Peter 3:15-16   *"and regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; just as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you, as also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things, in which there are some things that are hard to understand, which the untaught and unstable distort, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction."*  - 2 Tim. 3:16-17   *"All Scripture is inspired by God and beneficial for teaching, for rebuke, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man or woman of God may be fully capable, equipped for every good work."*  - Romans 10:17 *"Faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the Word of God" - 2Cor. 7:10  *"For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret, leading to salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces death."*    - Eph. 2:8-9  *"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast."*    - Acts 7:55-56,58; 8:1 *"But being full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed intently into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; and he said, ‚ÄúBehold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.‚Äù When they had driven him out of the city, they began stoning him; and the witnesses laid aside their cloaks at the feet of a young man named Saul. Saul was in hearty agreement with putting him to death. And on that day a great persecution began against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles."*  - Eph. 1:4-5 *"just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love, He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,"*    # Prevenient Grace  **Prevenient Grace** is a theological term used to describe the grace of God that precedes human decision and enables the sinner to respond to His offer of salvation. This grace is often associated with God's initiating work in salvation, softening the heart and drawing individuals to Him. While the term itself is not directly found in Scripture, its concept is reflected in several biblical passages.  ### Key Aspects of Prevenient Grace: 1. **God‚Äôs Initiative in Salvation**      Prevenient grace highlights that salvation begins with God, not human effort.      - *John 6:44*: "No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up on the last day."    - *Philippians 2:13*: "For it is God who is at work in you, both to desire and to work for His good pleasure."  2. **Enabling Response to the Gospel**      This grace is understood as God's work in enabling the spiritually dead sinner to respond to the gospel.      - *Ephesians 2:4-5*: "But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our wrongdoings, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved)."    - *Romans 2:4*: "Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and restraint and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?"  3. **The Universal Aspect of Grace**      Prevenient grace is often seen as universally available, giving every person the opportunity to respond to God.      - *Titus 2:11*: "For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people."    - *John 12:32*: "And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to Myself."  4. **Conviction of Sin**      The Holy Spirit‚Äôs role in convicting the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment is an expression of prevenient grace.      - *John 16:8*: "And He, when He comes, will convict the world regarding sin, and righteousness, and judgment."  ### Summary: Prevenient grace demonstrates God‚Äôs proactive love and mercy, breaking through human inability and spiritual deadness to make salvation possible. It aligns with passages like *Romans 5:8*‚Äî"But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us"‚Äîunderscoring that God always takes the first step toward humanity. This grace is not irresistible but works to enable the free choice to accept or reject the gospel.   Prevenient grace, therefore, is the foundation of God's redemptive work, ensuring that salvation remains an act of divine initiative and grace from start to finish (*Ephesians 2:8-9*).

6. Can you fix the formatting of the file so it flows and that scripture references are blockquotes and em.  Headers need to be consistent, and Table of Contents needs to be updated

7. based on this revision can you build a bible study for it

8. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-VQwLLVh1o7JhUSK8Fh5xjM", "size_bytes": 32869, "width": 468, "height": 100, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

9. can you fix this sentence: ‚Ä¢	We Hope in His resurrection that demonstrated His power over death, our hope is continually that if He was resurrected, and if we are in Him than we too shall be resurrected delivered from death and Hades.

10. Want it to begin with "We hope" as an active tense, daily

11. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-4ZNfHKiQsAbPyoJsDTAHaL", "size_bytes": 57464, "width": 468, "height": 135, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

12. Can this sentence speak more clearly and an emphasis on God's Holiness and our sinfulness being total direct opposite.  Keep it simple: Repentance is not a human decision but a grace granted by God, wrought by the Holy Spirit, and a response to the realization of God‚Äôs holiness and our own sinfulness. As Paul writes, "The kindness of God leads you to repentance." (Romans 2:4). It is God‚Äôs goodness and mercy, shown supremely in Christ‚Äôs sacrificial work, that draws sinners to genuine repentance.

13. In Romans 2:4 I need a discussion question regarding: 1. What is God's kindness, restraint and patience for

14. No, what are they for, He is showing kindness restraint and patience toward sinners, He is providing common grace allowing them to be moral agents, restrained from acting totally depraved according to their nature

15. my revision In verse 4, What is God‚Äôs kindness, restraint, and patience directed to?

16. In 1 peter verse God is patient perish

17. Besides Luke 6:68 and when Jesus says it is finished, where else does it say that Jesus "Accomplished" redemption?

18. I want to create a blogspot.com post about Abortion being an illustration of Prevenient Grace in that people believe that they have some form of life in them because of what Christ did on the cross, making it possible to believe.  I want it to have an Offensive title regarding the majority of the professing christians today believe in this form of Gospel which is not a gospel at all.  Galatians 1, Brood of vipers

19. No, these christians are hypocrites, they are against Abortion but they themselves practice it spiritually

20. abortion illustrates prevenient grace in that an unbeliever has the ability to choose life or "abort" life.  And that is what so called christians believe, although they believe physical abortion is an atrocity

21. Your message defines prevenient grace as the gospel, but in fact the irresistible grace is the true gospel, believers are hypocrites in that they believe prevenient grace brings everyone to the same level, you are right about the fact that the Holy Spirit restrains human total depravity through common grace, but it doesn't give them a position of having some form of spiritual life in them.  We are all Spiritually DEAD

22. This post confronts the hypocrisy of Christians who oppose physical abortion but embrace a theology that effectively denies the total depravity of mankind, undermines the work of the Holy Spirit, and rejects the truth of irresistible grace.  Should be oppose physical abortion but embraces a theology of spiritual abortion in that an non-believer has the right to choose his own destination....

23. what verse is no one seeks after God, no one chooses righteousness

24. This post confronts the hypocrisy of Christians who oppose physical abortion but embrace a theology of spiritual abortion, claiming that a non-believer has the right to choose his eternal destination denying the total depravity of mankind, undermines the work of the Holy Spirit, and rejecting the truth of God's grace.  this statement needs include a repentant heart.  "denying the first response to God's effectual grace? which is a repentent heart, its a haughty puffed up, prideful theology

25. Conclusion: Repent of Spiritual Abortion To claim Christ while preaching or believing a false gospel of prevenient grace is to commit spiritual abortion. It is to reject the truth of total depravity, deny the power of the Holy Spirit, and sever the life-giving message of the Gospel. Paul‚Äôs warning in Galatians 1 could not be clearer: ‚ÄúIf anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed‚Äù (Galatians 1:9).  Repent of this false gospel. Return to the truth of irresistible grace and proclaim the life-giving message of salvation through Christ alone. Reject the hypocrisy of spiritual abortion, and stand firm in the true Gospel of grace that brings the dead to life.  The conclusion statement, I like the verse.  I also want to rephrase the ending.  It needs to include God granting repentence and true repentence in Psalm 51

26. Examine ones heart to find yourself in the faith

## Spiritual Fool's Gold

1. I want to write a blog post about Spiritual Fools Gold, I am trying to complete it, this is what I have so far: Gold Rush The search for fine gold  Read 1 Corinthians 3:1 - 22  Yes, I get to finally talk about one of my favorite Petra songs "Fool's Gold". I didn't think it would come up because the context of the scripture is talking about heavenly treasure but then I saw it, vs 18 "he must become foolish, so that he may become wise".  But before I begin quoting the song, even though it is stuck in my head now.  I want to address the real reason for this devotion; Fine gold.  Have you seen the TV show on Discovery called Gold Rush? It showcases several different miners using various methods to extract gold from the earth. They design their extractors to catch as much fine gold as possible, and along the way, they also find small nuggets. At the end they weigh the gold and as they do you can see that is mostly fine gold, and I have seen it where that is all they catch.  Some spots they dig will turn up nuggets but it is not very common to do so.  During our ministry time, we have made it a point to interact with as many people as God has given.  From the time in March 2023 when we were in an airport, we encountered a family stranded in Boise, trying to get back home to California.  We prayed for them right there in the terminal, you can imagine the crowd around us, 1 commented to us about "how cool" that was to pray for them.  We've met others, and they all just open up to us, and I don't even ask to pray for them.  We've met people that have cancer,  questions about the bible, single mom who lost a well paying job to work at a grocery store, a student, a man who just came from the doctor in more pain than when he came.  ( I prayed for healing, and was impressed upon by God that he and his family or riders received faith and healing miraculously that day).  So many more, being in an RV park your close to a lot of people around you.  These are all fine gold moments.  More about this show called Gold Rush, they prospect for gold and measure the colors per yard of dirt, when they get a lot of colors in a gold pan, they call the dirt pay dirt.  They will go through 1 ton of dirt to get 1 to 2 ounces of gold, which in their case is really good.  I think God gave this show as a perfect illustration for our walk as Christians. We are planters, waterers, and sowers. Are

2. Can you include more bible verses in this post, in NASB2020.  The intro speaking of sowers, include the harvest, and the bema seat

62. back to resizing linux disk RHEL 7.9, on these systems I have parted but I don't have resizepart or growpart

63. so in vCenter it looks like Hard drive 1 is greyed out, but Hard drive 2 is available to resize, why is that.  What can I do to make HD1 available to resize

64. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-JTzbzuH37W8Mjm8mHShn8u", "size_bytes": 47101, "width": 782, "height": 555, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

69. how do you refresh the nfs mounts when they are not available.  Does a nfs service restart the best way to do it

70. can you create a step by step for the following statement:  Yes, but umount does not work due to blocking processes, so first stop rpcbind and nfslock services, clean /var/lib/nfs/statd/sm/* and /var/lib/nfs/statd/sm.bak/*, unmount and run mount -a, if it fails to unmount use umount -f

71. using parted resize, (resizepart not available). I get an error Partition /dev/sda1 is being used. you must unmount it before you modify it with parted.  This is the boot partition

72. So is there any other option on a RHEL 7.9 system

73. using SSH is there a way to run an SSH remote command like df -hT | grep /dev/sda1

74. If I feed it a host list, can I also provide a password, or if the password is the same will it authenticate for the entire list

76. Unable to negotiate with 172.17.164.9 port 22: no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa,ssh-dss

77. Can turn off yum cache so it doesn't need to do yum clean all

78. I have a cron job that runs yum clean all weekly, however if I manually run yum clean all, it will clear the cache, metadata, but then it will redownload them again.  the keepcache is =0 but I don't have a metadata entry in the yum.conf, this is what I have here: ls -l /var/cache/yum/x86_64/6Server/ total 56 drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Dec  5  2023 RHEL6_ELS_repo_BA drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Dec  5  2023 RHEL6_ELS_repo_BA_Optional drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Dec  5  2023 RHEL6_repo_BA drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Dec  5  2023 RHEL6_repo_BA_Extra drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Dec  5  2023 RHEL6_repo_BA_Optional drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Dec  2 22:05 rhel-6-server-els-optional-rpms drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Dec  2 22:05 rhel-6-server-els-rpms drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Dec  2 22:05 rhel-6-server-els-satellite-tools-6.10-rpms drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Dec  2 22:05 rhel-6-server-optional-rpms drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Dec  2 22:05 rhel-6-server-rh-common-rpms drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Dec  2 22:05 rhel-6-server-rpms drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Dec  5  2023 rhel-6-server-satellite-tools-6.7-rpms drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Dec  2 22:05 rhel-6-server-supplementary-rpms drw------- 4 root root 4096 Dec  2 22:05 rhel-server-rhscl-6-rpms

79. so we don't want to run any yum command for patching at this time, we just want to clean all and not have yum repopulate.  The disk space is low so we just want to keep yum from repopulating

80. how to create a compressed file using tar for a batch of files, so I can use wildcards. so tar -cvfz archive.javacore.*.tar.gz [original file name]javacore.20240403...txt --remove-files

81. So assuming we did have those 3 txt files, I would want each of them to be an archive_javacore.20240403.1.txt.tar.gz, archive....2.txt.tar.gz, archive....3.txt.tar.gz

82. how do you add a chrome bookmark tab file (html) to brave browser

85. How do you find out what version of Red hat you are running

86. is swap not being used, to be expected on this environment? free -h              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached Mem:          5.8G       5.4G       483M       4.9M       241M       560M -/+ buffers/cache:       4.6G       1.3G Swap:         2.0G         0B       2.0G [virtuser@mtllamdm003 ~]$ cat /etc/redhat-release Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.10 (Santiago)

87. yes my system was swappiness was set to 60 I set it to 30 because it was alerting for high swap usage, 1.8g of the 2.0g being used

88. We received an error: Triggered: [vSphere] vCenter Connection Issue on vcenter_server We are able to ping it and it shows up, but the alert still is triggering

## Old vs New Covenant

1. I need to write a paper on the old covenant and new covenant, which of the # of covenants God had with Israel, that Christ fulfilled with the "New Covenant" and are Christians a part of the New Covenant?  Hebrews refers to the New Covenant, but it speaks of the House of Judah and Israel specifically.  I know part of the New Covenant is fulfilled when Christ sets up His Kingdom, "and all of Israel will be saved in a day"

2. Is there a verse that indicates when the new covenant was started

## Acts Chapter Summaries

1. using this format and NASB2020 I need chapter summaries to be formatted like this: In the first chapter births are announced and those receiving the announcements respond. Jesus is presented as the Savior of mankind. Those who hope for a Savior should rejoice at his birth. In the second chapter the child Jesus is recognized at birth, through circumcision and in training. Jesus is presented as amazing. Believers should know this child‚Äôs heavenly origin, prophetic fulfillment and divine wisdom. In Chapter 3 Luke gives John the Baptist‚Äôs biography, and Jesus‚Äô genealogy. Jesus is presented as the divinely chosen scion of humanity. Believers should look to him as the Son of Man. In chapter 4 Jesus comes from the temptation to begin his ministry in Galilee. Jesus comes across as a plain man with spectacular effect. Believers should be careful not to reject the plain humanity of Jesus. In chapter 5 Jesus calls disciples including fishermen, a leper, a paralytic, and a tax collector. Jesus cares for men in their circumstances. Believers should come to Jesus for his care. In chapter 6 Jesus claims lordship of the Sabbath and instructs his disciples on good and evil. Jesus is a sage teacher of men. Believers should get their ethics from Jesus. In chapter 7 Jesus responds to faith in a centurion, two women, and John the Baptist‚Äôs disciples. Jesus is the object of faith. Believers should always make Jesus the object of their faith. In Chapter 8 after introducing women disciples Jesus tells and explains parables. He also performs outstanding miracles. Jesus is a teacher with power. Believers should heed his teaching. Apostolic confessions in chapter 9 are central to the works of Jesus in sending them out, feeding 5,000, foretelling his death, and healing. Jesus is a servant who faces rejection and death. Believers must also believe in his death. In chapter 10 personal experiences of Jesus and his disciples abound. Jesus is full of the Holy Spirit. Believers who go in the power of the Holy Spirit bring joy to Jesus. In chapter 11 Jesus‚Äô opposition reacts to him. Jesus offends with his prayer, healing, and condemnation of his opponents. Jesus confronts his opposition on his way to Jerusalem. Believers should beware hypocrisy.

2. **_In Chapter 5, Luke_**, **_Christ is presented as_**, **_Believers should_** I like the simple statement length, but for each section, the statement should be a snippet of the chapter with the verse reference (*vs.1*)  can I get that list again, I like the chapter summaries you provided I just need scripture proof for each statement

## NTSurvey Assignments

1. Can you help answer these questions:  format them in markdown: MATTHEW What was Matthew‚Äôs relationship to Jesus? Matthew wrote from Antioch about what year? What was Matthew‚Äôs main concern as he wrote? Matthew wrote his gospel primarily for whom? MARK What was Mark‚Äôs relationship to Jesus? Mark wrote from Rome about what year? Whose preaching did Mark represent as he wrote? Mark wrote his gospel primarily for whom? LUKE What was Luke‚Äôs relationship to Jesus? Luke wrote from Caesarea or Rome about what year? Whose preaching did Luke represent as he wrote? Luke wrote his gospel primarily for whom?

2. Are you able to help me answering these questions?  - What problems do they see with the ‚ÄòSynoptic Problem‚Äô?  In Thomas and Gundry, A Harmony of the Gospels essays 3-5 deal with the critics of the gospels and their theories. Each gives answers to these theories. Either working alone or in a group, choose an essay: ‚ÄúSource criticism‚Äù, ‚ÄúForm Criticism‚Äù, or ‚ÄúRedaction Criticism‚Äù to read and then answer these questions:  - What is source, form or redaction criticism?  - How does it fail to explain the material in the gospels?  - What is the answer to this type of criticism?

3. Can you provide reference evidence from the 3 essays in your statements

4. can you provide reference page numbers

5. based on these essays can you just answer this question first with a simplified answer, the definition is provided for each criticism by page number.  What is source, form, or redaction criticism?

6. This is how I wrote it:  - What is source, form or redaction criticism? The definition of **source criticism** is at the bottom of page 274, *"This method investigates the written sources that gospel writers may have used, such as the theory that Mark or a hypothetical "Q" document served as sources for Matthew and Luke."* The definition of **form criticism** is at the bottom of page 280, *"This approach examines the oral traditions behind the gospel accounts, classifying them into literary forms (e.g., parables, miracles) to study their historical and cultural origins."* The definition of **redaction criticism** is in the second paragraph of page 287, *"This method analyzes how gospel writers edited and arranged their material to emphasize specific theological themes or address the needs of their audiences."*

7. - How does it fail to explain the material in the gospels?  The answers are provided as the following: This can be answered for source criticism from the list beginning on p. 277. The answer for form criticism begins in the first full paragraph of page 282 and continues through the next three unit headings. The answer for redaction criticism is found in the list of weaknesses beginning on p. 292.

8. can you provide a simple sentence for all three

9. - What is the answer to this type of criticism?

10. can you provide a simple sentence for these

11. Wondering if you can fill all these cells in markdown format? | | Definition | Weaknesses | Answer | |:-----:|:----:|:-----:|:----:| | Source Criticism | | | | | Form Criticism | | | | | Redaction Criticism | | | |

12. can you provide a simple sentence to this question? - What is the synoptic problem, the proposed solutions and the historic view of the church?

13. - Write an ‚ÄúI believe‚Äù statement that begins, ‚ÄúI believe that the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, though very similar in content and structure, are _____________________.‚Äù  I believe the the gospels of Matt, Mark, Luke... are divinely inspired, written at the proper time to address the issues of the timeperiod and to the proper audience to provide edification and hope to persecuted saints.  God's providence through time has established that these were individually written and accounts are similar because that is how God established it, providing the Living word to generations of saints encoragement, hope and salvation faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God Rom 10:17

14. Matthew 8:2-4, Mark 1:40-45 and Luke 5:12-16 are considered to be an example of the same event in each of the synoptic gospels. Read Thomas and Gundry, *A Harmony of the Gospels p. 53.*    - Note the similarities between them. What differences can you find? Obviously it was the same event, it was a messianic miracle, to show the priests would announce Jesus was the Messiah.  The romans and greeks wouldn't understand this but the Matthew readers would.  No real differences only in what Jesus did specifically in Luke afterwards.

15. - Read the context before and after and discuss the circumstances.

16. can you provide 1 sentence for the three before, event, after

17. - What does the way Jesus deals with lepers tell us about Jesus‚Äô concerns of those of the culture in which He lived? He had no concern for the pharasees oral law to touch unclean since He himself is not affected by the uncleanliness.

18. - Why would touching be significant to each of the authors given what you know about them? Why do you think that Mark gives more detail?

19. can you print out the verses listed ? nasb2020 *Read and compare Matthew 22:9 and Luke 14:23.* 1. In what ways do Luke and Matthew share a missionary interest?

20. I will use the conclusion, however I want to emphasis that the traditional boundaries were well known in the known world at that time was Israel and that the marginlized was the 'Gentile dogs', sickly, weak, and widows and orphans.  These were all seen by the Jews as less than human

21. can you take out my references and shorten the summary

22. display the verses for the following statements: **Read the following verses and tell what they say about each category.**   - Women: Luke 7:12, 23:49, 55ff

23. Display the verses Luke 23: around the crucifixion

24. can you display the rest of 23

25. And can you tell me what the ancient Jewish or world culture of that day thought of women, including widows.  Can you provide proof text

26. Using women in the gospels, provides evidence that a man would not normally write a story, using women to coborate the gospel accounts.  so with that in mind how would you answer my original question

27. Display the verses mentioned and provide a summary only for this: Children: Luke 7:12, 8:42, 9:38, 18:15

28. We should have faith as a child, provide verse, and a simple short summary

29. Social relations: Luke 7:36-50, 11:37-44, 14:1-4, 10:38-42, 19:1-10, 10:38-42, 11:5-8, 15:8-10, 22ff

30. can you display the actual verses

38. how do you interpret the persistent widow parable

39. After reading Luke 1:1-4, state what is already known about Luke and Theophilus.

40. How do you think that the book of Acts continues Luke‚Äôs purposes in his Gospel?

41. Please cite any ways we have used Acts to complete the story of the gospels. "we" being the christian saints throughout the church age

42. I will only use the conclusion but I want to point out the acts of the church include missionaries, charity work suchas hospitals, feeding the poor, orphanages, and all christian services throughout time have been all because of work of the early church

43. What in Acts seems similar to Luke to you? The key verse is *Acts 1:8* and should be a memory verse.

44. How does Acts 1:8 predicate the development of this history?

45. Compare the **outlines** of *Benware, Survey of the New Testament* and *Nelson, Maps and Charts* to see the logic of Luke‚Äôs writing and the emphases of the Acts of the Apostles.

46. How would you describe Mark‚Äôs character having read Mark 14:51, Acts 12:12ff, Col.4:10 & Philemon 24, Acts 13:5 & 15:37‚Äì39, 2 Tim. 4:11, 1 Peter 5:13, Acts 13:3?

47. **Read *Thomas and Gundry, A Harmony of the Gospels pp. 36-37, 50-51, 95-96*.** 1. What kinds of connections are there between Matthew, Mark and Luke when they cover the same material?  2. What are some of the differences between them?

48. can you summarize the connections and the differences in 2 separate paragraphs

49. 3. What conclusions could you draw about Mark‚Äôs writing from this comparison?

## Update AWS S3 Website

1. How do I update an existing AWS S3 hosted website with an new interface, keeping the some existing directories of the old site.

2. Having an issue with mapping a directory for .mp3 file locations "17:39:40 [WARN] [router] getStaticPaths() returned an invalid path param: "slug". `undefined` expected for an optional param, but got empty string. 17:39:40 [ERROR] [build] Failed to call getStaticPaths for src/pages/sermons/[album]/[slug].astro" The mp3 and directory locations are not on my development environment, so I need the slug to map to      return sermons.map(sermon => ({       params: {         album,         slug: sermon.path.name.replace('.mp3', '')       },       props: { sermon }     }));   }); sermons.ts 				"title": "1 Corinthians Part 3", 				"speaker": "Pastor Jack Hurley", 				"album": "1Corinthians", 				"date": "1997", 				"name": "1corinthians-part3.mp3", 				"path": "sermons/1cor/", 				"description": "1 Corinthians 1:13-17" 			}, see how the path is path.name to the mp3 files

3. Ok, the [slug].astro:  export async function getStaticPaths() {   const albums = getUniqueAlbums();   return albums.flatMap(album => {     const sermons = getSermonsByAlbum(album);     return sermons.map(sermon => ({       params: {         album,         slug: sermon.name.replace('.mp3', '')       },       props: { sermon }     }));   }); }  const { sermon } = Astro.props; const pdfUrl = getPdfUrl(sermon); const audioUrl = getAudioUrl(sermon);  sermonUtils.ts has a sermon.path sermon.name: export function getAudioUrl(sermon: Sermon): string {   return `/${sermon.path}${sermon.name}`;

4. So the site is brand new, all I want is to keep a directory in public called sermons with subdirectories. So I will basically need to delete everything else

5. Can I push the website from stackblitz to aws s3

6. how do I create a mailto link

7. I have a facebook group that I would like people visiting to click on to request to join?  How do I create the link

8. Actually it is a profile

9. running npm build I am getting the following errors: 08:26:58 ‚ñ∂ src/pages/sermons/[slug].astro 08:26:58 [ERROR] [build] Failed to call getStaticPaths for src/pages/sermons/[slug].astro [GetStaticPathsRequired] `getStaticPaths()` function is required for dynamic routes. Make sure that you `export` a `getStaticPaths` function from your dynamic route.   Hint:     See https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/#dynamic-routes for more information on dynamic routes.          Alternatively, set `output: "server"` or `output: "hybrid"` in your Astro config file to switch to a non-static server build. This error can also occur if using `export const prerender = true;`.     See https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/ for more information on non-static rendering.   Error reference:     https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/errors/get-static-paths-required/   Location:     src/pages/sermons/[slug].astro:0:0   Stack trace:     at new AstroError (file:///home/ireaneus/bolt-adjusted-gfmhlwrv-web/node_modules/astro/dist/core/errors/errors.js:37:5)     at Module.callGetStaticPaths (file:///home/ireaneus/bolt-adjusted-gfmhlwrv-web/node_modules/astro/dist/core/render/route-cache.js:35:26)     at generatePage (file:///home/ireaneus/bolt-adjusted-gfmhlwrv-web/node_modules/astro/dist/core/build/generate.js:181:25)     at async Module.staticBuild (file:///home/ireaneus/bolt-adjusted-gfmhlwrv-web/node_modules/astro/dist/core/build/static-build.js:125:5)     at async AstroBuilder.run (file:///home/ireaneus/bolt-adjusted-gfmhlwrv-web/node_modules/astro/dist/core/build/index.js:197:7)

10. ok, here is the file with getStaticPaths in it, can you incorporate step 2 and 3 in it also are the albums.ts and sermons.ts files referenced

11. where will the console logs be produced, will it be in the terminal window with the npm build

12. can I run the npm build with an output.log file so I can

13. Updated [slug].astro is not referencing any of my original [slug].astro provided, I will include sermonUtils to help with your modification

14. So this is just between the --- lines in [slug].astro correct

15. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-RfLacndnuXUHQN5TDBb59a", "size_bytes": 41820, "width": 664, "height": 103, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

16. These are the errors I am getting (analyze image) also the file you read you made the mistake on the location of sermonUtils so I don't think you are one-for-one modifying the file correctly

17. Ok 2 errors on [slug].astro before build:   // Flatten the data and extract sermon objects   const sermonList = Object.values(sermons).flatMap((module) => module.sermons); Property 'sermons' does not exist on type 'unknown'.  and getSermonBySlug is not utilized.

18. Module '"../../../utils/sermonUtils"' declares 'Sermon' locally, but it is not exported. 'Sermon' is declared here.

19. It works with no problem, now here is the output when i do npm run build

20. Do I need to create public/sermons/[sermondirectories] from the sermons.ts in order for it to pass the build?  the dev runs and console log shows my traversing directories.  of course I don't have the mp3 files in the dev environment, but I don't have the directories either.  They are on the webserver

21. Ok so in order for my sermons.ts "path" to work, I don't think that is referenced in album.ts for "id" so my directories would not work because they don't match, so I manually changed album.id to match sermon.path.subdirectory. and I changed the directories under public/sermons to match the new album.id == sermon.path.subdirectory and I get the error in this log when accessing the albums

22. staticpaths is not using globEager

23. this is very confusing, you are not referencing the completed files.  Here is the updated files, can you fix the error from them? remember public/sermons/[album.id]==[sermons.path.subdirectory] now.

24. can you provide the complete [slug].astro up to the style, incorporating your lastest update

25. 

26. getSermonsbyAlbum is still not be used from sermonUtils.  Also can you incorporate your last post into my [slug].astro

27. now the import { sermons } is not loading as well, but we are still getting error

28. 

29. Did not implement latest slug.astro, here is my, do I need to include album.ts info there

30. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-UAZPnM5F1xs7Datobjx22o", "size_bytes": 172623, "width": 1240, "height": 300, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

31. Ok, I am starting to see what is going on, however the sermons schema had videoURL but I removed it, where is it referencing that, and should I build a schema for album.ts and include the rest of the schema of sermon.ts (please reference the files I already uploaded, here is the problems from your latest [slug].astro

32. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-3bSRV2GwwYerZeCciy6thb", "size_bytes": 53208, "width": 1195, "height": 148, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

33. oops removed node_modules/astro and .astro directories from project, I did an npm install and got the node_modules/astro directory back but not the .astro directory, also these problems showed up before I did that

34. {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-1DvntHtze5wdRgTrEjA6uV", "size_bytes": 26851, "width": 582, "height": 106, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}

35. down to 2 errors in slug

36. Now no problems with the code, so I am going to run npm run dev.  Wish me Blessing

41. well here we go again

42. Ok I changed the astro.whatever.mjx file, for date I set it to string, that eliminated the problems, but the sermon album page slug still has the same issue, will capture the log

43. Ok, so before the album page was loading up all the meta data from sermons.ts and would display  the number of sermons per album, now it is listing at 0, so I want it to read from the static ts file sermons.ts instead of the directory.  so if it can just read from that sermons.ts and populate a static list from sermons.ts using all the schema to populate each album page.

44. can you make your modifications from this file, so it keeps the imports directories, your post messed up the import directories.  Also I didn't see entry for pdf if exists in baselayout, so please keep the format of the file the same but incorporate your changes

45. Type '{ children: any[]; key: string; }' is not assignable to type 'LiHTMLAttributes'.   Property 'key' does not exist on type 'LiHTMLAttributes'.

46. how do I clear cache, it still errors for getStatic blah

47. how do I grep for getStaticPaths in all files at .

48. cleared cache, node_module, package-lock did all the things but I still get the error when I build: 14:30:34 ‚ñ∂ src/pages/sermons/[album]/[slug].astro 14:30:34 [ERROR] [build] Failed to call getStaticPaths for src/pages/sermons/[album]/[slug].astro [GetStaticPathsRequired] `getStaticPaths()` function is required for dynamic routes.

4. how can I restart an SSH agent

5. How do i stop background processes ie. I had a tunnel running using the & to free up the shell, but now I need to stop the tunnel

6. how can I change shell for a temporary session from ksh to bash

7. can I verify what my current shell is now

8. I know this will sound like a newbie question, but I am a seasoned linux administrator.  However I am on a ubuntu jumpbox, and I was able to previously > ssh exampleuser@linuxserver.net after starting a new terminal (new day) gcloud auth login from terminal - gcloud compute ssh jumpbox (defaulting to using IAP tunneling) connected to jumpbox > ssh exampleuser@linuxserver.net ssh: Could not resolve hostname : Name or service not known I've done the following: pinged successfully linuxserver - resolves to linuxserver.net Verified exampleuser is on system tried multiple systems restarted ssh-agent and verified running It feels like an authentication issue with Google IAP, the Jumpbox is on 1 project and the linuxserver is on another, their IP addresses are in different subnets. This started happening yesterday after from another terminal window I changed project ids for another jumpbox login. PS. I am unfortunately on a Mac

9. vCenter vmware - Enable CPU Hot Add and Memory what do these do

10. For linux hard drives does that work too

11. Linux server stops pinging

12. ping: socket: Operation not permitted

13. check status and info of NetworkManager to see if it is persistent

14. it is set to disabled, is it because the system is running networking?

15. so it says sudo systemctl status networking: Unit networking.service could not be found

16. how can I check systemd-networkd is on this system.  What version of linux do I have

17. This is REDHAT 7.9 Maipo is it using systemd-networkd

18. it looks like network-scripts is used can I verify that was supposed to run at startup?  I am sshed into it after we restarted NetworkManager, so I am using that for now, but if I can verify network-scripts were used I need to configure it or check log files to see why after 12 pings it stopped pinging when it was rebooted

19. This is the result of: > sudo systemctl is-enabled network network.service is not a native service, redirecting to /sbin/chkconfig. Executing /sbin/chkconfig network --level=5 enabled

20. This the result of: sudo journalctl -u network -- Logs begin at Tue 2024-11-19 22:32:22 UTC, end at Tue 2024-11-19 23:13:28 UTC. -- Nov 19 22:32:27 mtllaiib601 systemd[1]: Starting LSB: Bring up/down networking...

21. from my results does is look like both are running? I'm afraid of disabling NetworkManager becuse that is what got me in, so if I disable network, the next time it is rebooted it is going to default to network and stop pinging.  Do you think the IP6 delay is causeing it to stop pinging maybe I need to wait for like 5 mins after a reboot to see if it will starting pinging again?

22. Could I restart network while keeping NetworkManager running

23. Maybe I should just disable or stop the networking and let it run with NetworkManager

24. It stopped pinging

25. ok that worked, restarted network, and stopped NetworkManager.  Do you know what application has DataFlowEngine as a process?  Also how can I check to see what processes start at onboot on this Red hat system

28. are all the logrotate config files in /etc/logrotate.d/

With the following version RHEL 7.9 (Maipo)When I run the following command I get: -> tar -zpcvf "/opt/CA/webagent/log/sm_trace_log-ihs_log._$(date '+%Y_%m_%d').tar.gz" $(find /opt/CA/webagent/log  -mtime +2  -type f   -name "sm_trace_log-ihs.log.*"  ! -name "*.gz" -printf '%f\n' | grep -v "\.$") --remove-files  find: invalid argument `+2 ' to `-mtime' tar: Cowardly refusing to create an empty archive Try `tar --help' or `tar --usage' for more information.

33. Can we setup a cron job that will do that weekly

34. Can the echo create a log file for this cronjob instead

35. Instead of opt/scripts can I keep the cronjob archive_logs in the same folder as the other cronjobs

36. how can I use echo instead of vim to write this script file

37. can you create a document for these steps, use vi to edit the archive_logs.sh instead use name webagent_logs.sh, also the log file should be webagent_logs.log and all this will be in the /opt/CA/webagent/log directory and user should be virtuser when creating all this so a change user will need to be executed

38. Is there a way to clear cache in a Mac Terminal window, of any varables or cached ssh credentials

What do you believe about the Bible?  > We teach that the Bible is God's written revelation to man, and thus the sixty six books of the Bible given to us by the Holy Spirit constitute the plenary (inspired equally in all parts) Word of God (I Corinthians 2:7, 14; II Peter 1:20-21).  > We teach that the Word of God is an objective revelation (I Thessalonians 2:13; 1 Corinthians 2:13), verbally inspired in every word (II Timothy 3:16), absolutely inerrant in the original documents, infallible, and God breathed.  We teach the literal, grammatical historical interpretation of Scripture which affirms the belief that the opening chapters of Genesis present creation in six literal days (Genesis 1:31; Exodus 31:17).  > We teach that the Bible constitutes the only infallible rule of faith and practice (Matthew 5:18, 24:35; John 10:35, 16:12-13, 17:17; I Corinthians 2:13; II Timothy 3:15-17; Hebrews 4:12;   > We teach that God spoke in His written Word by a process of dual authorship.  The Holy Spirit so superintended the human authors that, through their individual personalities and different styles of writing, they composed and recorded God's Word to man (II Peter 1:20-21) without error in the whole or in the part (Matthew 5:18; II Timothy 3:16).  We teach that, whereas there may be several applications of any given passage of Scripture, there is but one true interpretation.  The meaning of Scripture is to be found as one diligently applies the literal grammatical historical method of interpretation under the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit (John 7:17, 16:12-15; I Corinthians 2:7-15; I John 2:20).  It is the responsibility of believers to ascertain carefully the true intent and meaning of Scripture, recognizing that proper application is binding on all generations.  Yet the truth of Scripture stands in judgment of men; never do men stand in judgment of it.  **Key Scriptures**: -  1 Corinthians 2:7, 14 -  2 Timothy 3:16-17; -  2 Peter 1:20-21; -  Revelation 22:18-19; -  Deuteronomy 4:2; -  Matthew 5:18

88. is there any duplication of thought in your revision

89. verbally inspiration is mentioned can you add plenary inspiration to that statement

90. I would like to make the "the chief end of man" personal but reference it as part of the Westminister confession: I believe my ultimate purpose in life is to worship, serve, and honor God in everything I do, finding my deepest joy in Him. - **Scripture References**:   - *1 Corinthians 10:31* ‚Äì "Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."   - *Psalm 73:25-26* ‚Äì "Whom have I in heaven but You? And besides You, I desire nothing on earth. 26My flesh and my heart may fail, But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever."   - *Romans 11:36* ‚Äì "For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things."

91. This statement about my belief in the bible has duplication in meaning and the word inspired is mentioned more than once, can you help me rephrase it to be more concise?  I believe the Bible is God‚Äôs written revelation to mankind. The sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments, inspired by the Holy Spirit, form the complete and authoritative Word of God (1 Corinthians 2:7,14; 2 Peter 1:20-21).  I affirm the plenary (full) and verbal inspiration of the Bible, meaning that every word, in all parts, is equally inspired and without error in the original manuscripts, infallible, and God-breathed (2 Timothy 3:16). The Bible alone is the only infallible rule of faith and practice, eternally relevant and authoritative over all aspects of life (Matthew 5:18; John 16:12-13, 17:17).  The Holy Spirit superintended the human authors of Scripture, ensuring that their writings, while reflecting their individual personalities, recorded God's Word without error in any part (2 Peter 1:20-21). This process guaranteed the Bible's reliability and accuracy (2 Timothy 3:16).  While there may be multiple applications of any passage, there is only one true interpretation, determined through careful study using the literal, grammatical-historical method, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit (John 7:17; (1 Corinthians 2:7-15). Every believer is responsible for applying Scripture‚Äôs truth in their lives. Scripture stands as the final judge of mankind; never does mankind stand in judgment of Scripture.

92. couple of corrections, need to include plenary and verbal inspiration, also only once is needed infallable, inerrant, immutable statements, as well as an emphasis on that through God's providence that He predetermined the authors, to provide their personality, circumstances, and environment to write the scriptures according to God's word according to exactly what He wanted it to say. Also it must be the original manuscripts were the infallable inerrant, and immutable..

93. instead of reflecting God's perfect will can you provide just a statement about God's perfect revelation to man

94. Can you remove the last two paragraphs and include **Key Scriptures** at the bottom with them written out in the NASB1995 version

95. **Anthrocentric vs. Theocentric** can you provide a definition

44. For the topic of Fellowship I have picked the subtopic of fellowship of the believers can you reference all bible verses that speak of this type of fellowship

45. What have I learned from these scriptures that talk about the communion of believers: > - Acts 2:42 *They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles‚Äô teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.* > - 1 Sam 23:16 *And Jonathan, Saul‚Äôs son, arose and went to David at Horesh, and encouraged him in God.* > - Psalm 119:63 *I am a companion of all those who fear You, And of those who keep Your precepts.* > - Psalm 133:1-3 *Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brothers to dwell together in unity! 2It is like the precious oil upon the head, Coming down upon the beard, Even Aaron‚Äôs beard, Coming down upon the edge of his robes. 3It is like the dew of Hermon Coming down upon the mountains of Zion; For there the Lord commanded the blessing‚Äîlife forever.* > - Mal 3:16 *Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another, and the Lord gave attention and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and who esteem His name.* > - Luke 22:32 *but I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail; and you, when once you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.‚Äù* > - Luke 24:17; 32 *And He said to them, ‚ÄúWhat are these words that you are exchanging with one another as you are walking?‚Äù And they stood still, looking sad; they said to one another, ‚ÄúWere not our hearts burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was explaining the Scriptures to us?‚Äù* > - John 17:21-22 *I do not ask on behalf of these alone, but for those also who believe in Me through their word; 21that they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me.* > - Romans 12:15-16 *Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep. 16Be of the same mind toward one another; do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own estimation.* > - 1 Cor 12:12-13 * For even as the body is one and yet has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ. 13For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.* > - Eph 4:2-6 *with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love, 3being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 4There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling; 5one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 6one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.* > - Col 3:16 *Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God.* > - 1 Thess 4:18; 5:11 *Therefore comfort one another with these words.; Therefore encourage one another and build up one another, just as you also are doing.* > - Heb. 3:13 *But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called ‚ÄúToday,‚Äù so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.* > - Heb. 10:24-25 *and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, 25not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.* > - James 5:16 *Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much.*

46. Can you help fill in the gap for this statement: Communion of the Saints means to comfort, encourage one another while it is still called 'Today', so that we may not be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. But also when we do sin, we can confess them one to another. We are one body and when one part of the body hurts, the rest of it knows it and wants to help to heal and elliviate the pain

47. I'm trying to write a personal statement of faith, I need the following organized and scripture references (NASB1995) and expounded upon.  Also add a personal testimonial statement (brief summary) - I believe I am saved because of the work of Jesus Christ alone, that He chose me before the foundation of the world to be elect, redeemed, born again, saved from my sins - I believe that God the Father gave Jesus the Son the authority and priviledge to create all things, through Him nothing was created. He created it out of nothing. - I believe He created everything in a literal 6 days, that there is a literal 1000yr reign of Christ, literal 7yr tribulation, the Bible can be interpreted literally - I believe in the providence of God, inasmuch as He directs my path, and even in my disobedience to Him I am responsible for my actions good or bad, He predetermined my path. - I believe in Him as the creator loving His creation to the utmost degree that even in the depths of the sea, He is there. Even the dust particles that dance on the sun beam have been choreographed by Him. - I believe in the Chief end of man being to Glorify God and enjoy Him forever - I believe in the 5 solas, the doctrines of Grace, dispensationalism theology, Rapture before Tribulation

48. Take a normal doctrine of Faith statement and break that last post into those categories, ie. God the father, Jesus Christ...

## Sermon Proofreading Request

1. Creating a sermon on John 6, the first few verses mention the passover, thus it was written with the exodus story in mind and Christ is the greater example of the manna. But we will not reveal this till after verse 32.  I have an intro written can you proofread and fix it grammatically

2. John the writer, (God the author) Begins with 'After these things..', and in vs. 4 he mentions 'the Passover is near' so it has been nearly a year that he starts ch. 6 from the events of ch. 5.  Now this story is the feeding of the 5000 which is the only miracle that is recorded in all 4 gospels.  So even though the other gospels speak of this event, John felt it important to record it as well.

3. I need something more impactful without revealing too much, about "Despite the fact that the other Gospels also recount this event, John felt it was important to include it in his account as well."

4. He includes this miracle to tie in or corralate an old testament truth

5. John, the writer (with God as the author), begins chapter 6 with the phrase "After these things..." and in verse 4, he mentions that "the Passover is near." This indicates that nearly a year has passed since the events of chapter 5.  And so the theme of this chapter is that of the first passover or the Exodus story. We will pick up at John 5:46 you will see that John will in Ch. 6  begin to illustrate it through the feeding of the 5000.

6. And so the theme of this chapter is that of the Exodus story which was the end result of the first Passover. We will pick up at John 5:46 you will see that John begins to illustrate the exodus and how moses was seen as a picture of Christ

7. can I use a different word or phrase for culmination or end result, the exodus was the outcome of the passover so I am looking for a word emphasis for that accomplishment

8. something more powerful accomplishment

9. I want to demonstrate that the Exodus story and the first 7 verses of Chapter 6 are preordained or was the foreknowledge of God (planned) picture from the lesser to the greater:  This is the only miracle that was recorded in all 4 gospels, and John takes this opportunity to illustrate what Moses writes in Exodus to point to Christ, not only the picture of the Passover Lamb, but in the water and the manna from heaven.  John also wants to illustrate how Moses was a picture of Christ, even in the events of exodus, demonstrating the sovereignty of God, predetermined and foreknowledge of God.  ## Mark 6:32-34 32. *And they went away in the boat to a secluded place by themselves.* 34. *When Jesus went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and He felt compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and He began to teach them many things.*  ### Exodus events described with the feeding of 5000 1. Jesus crosses sea 2. To a remote wilderness where there is no means to sustain them 3. Large crowd follows Him  4. He went up the mountain (crowd below)

10. Looking for scripture that speaks of the orchestrative nature of God to perform His will perfectly.  I know there is a verse in Job talking about ocean waves only going so far.  I wrote this paragraph to illustrate it: This is the only miracle that was recorded in all 4 gospels, and John seizes this one miracle to illustrate the connection between what Moses wrote in Exodus and the person of Christ. Not only does the Passover Lamb, the water from the rock, and the manna from heaven, images that find their greater fulfillment in Christ, it is also the actions that both Moses and Jesus does during this miracle that points to an omnipotient God whose perfect will is accomplished even in the minor details of the scripture, the control of ocean waves, the orbit of atoms, dust particles, stars brightness, the path of deep sea creatures, our lives, world events

11. Can you use the NASB1995 version instead of ESV

12. also in the psalms it speaks of stars placed and named? hairs on our head

## Stabilizing Fifth Wheel

1. Is it okay to manually lower the jack stands on a fifth wheel due to erosion of dirt and rocks underneath so as to keep it from rocking or swaying

2. I need to write an email to the manufacturer regarding an installation decrepancy.  I am providing pictures of the error that caused this issue and it basically requires several more hours of labor to be charged because of it. [Hello Service dept] as you can see from the attached pictures, we ran into a problem trying to get the tank aligned with the pipes on the RV, and to mount it properly.  The tank pipe hole and rubber seal would lift out of the hole so the tank would not mount properly and the water from the pipe would spill out over the top of the tank. We spent several hours trying to get it mounted thus incurring more hours than was allotted.  We finally discovered that the tank hole was 1 1/4" away from both pipes so the tank would sit mounted on the floor of the RV at an angle, thus the brackets would not work properly, (leaving a gap on the bracket holding the tank) this caused the tank to drop when the tank was full of water.  The whole tank and brackets are now fixed and properly secured, along with some straps to keep it from ever having issue again, however the amount of labor hours the Mobile RV tech needs to charge for this item is well over 4-5hrs and we would like to have him compensated for his time of 8hrs worth of work.  I myself as the owner of the RV spent over 6hrs working with him to make sure this underbelly was travel ready. I however do not require any payment for my time because I just wanted to be sure this was going to be ready for travel

## Lot's Influence on Christians

1. analysis my blog post writing format Wow, to describe Lot as righteous and that his story is not only recorded in the O.T. but also in the New.  I mean he wasn't supposed to even be in the story if it weren't for the fact that Abram disobeyed God in the beginning and took Lot with him. (See Genesis 12:1 and 4).  Now he's got several  paragraphs and sentences written about him.  But if it wasn't for him, this current batch of American Christians would be living like they are serving God and not man or themselves.  If it wasn't for his eyes that looked on the valley and said "It is well watered, I think I'll settle there" instead of looking to God for the place he should dwell.    That started the long road of Christian Carnality for Lot, he saw the fertile land was good for his flock, then the city of Sodom enticed him to living in a permanent shelter instead of living in tents like his uncle Abraham.  Then he thought he could reform the city so he sat in with the elders, he even called them "Brothers" which they knew he was not one of them.

2. Using what I have posted so far, complete the Blog post using 2 Peter 2:7‚Äì8 ESV and Genesis 12:1-4 for reference

3. Provide alternative titles

4. This is what I have so far as a blog post:  From Disobedience to Redemption: Unveiling Lot's Impact on American Christians Bible Verses Genesis 12:1  Now the LORD said to Abram, ‚ÄúGo from your country and your kindred and your father‚Äôs house to the land that I will show you. (ESV)  Genesis 12:4  So Abram went, as the LORD had told him, and Lot went with him.(ESV) 2 Peter 2:7‚Äì8  [7] and if he rescued righteous Lot, greatly distressed by the sensual conduct of the wicked  [8] (for as that righteous man lived among them day after day, he was tormenting his righteous soul over their lawless deeds that he saw and heard);    Introduction: Wow! It's truly remarkable how a seemingly incidental character like Lot can leave an indelible mark on the biblical narrative. His story is not only recorded in the Old Testament but also in the New Testament, underscoring the importance of the lessons we can glean from his experiences. In this blog post, we'll explore the profound impact of Lot's choices and reflect on their relevance for us today.

5. please rewrite this:Wow! It is truly remarkable how a seemingly incidental character like Lot can leave an indelible mark on the biblical narrative. His story is not only recorded in the Old Testament but also in the New Testament, demanding the reader's attention. I hope this blog post reveals the complacency of the American Christian today, and their need to come back to the Father

6. please proof read this: Bible Verses  Genesis 12:1  Now the LORD said to Abram, ‚ÄúGo from your country and your kindred and your father‚Äôs house to the land that I will show you. (ESV)  Genesis 12:4  So Abram went, as the LORD had told him, and Lot went with him.(ESV) Abram's Disobedience These 2 verses introduces us to Abram, and his nephew Lot.  However it also introduces our sinfulness which gets in the way of our full obedience to God.  Can you spot the sin in these verses?  Abram was instructed to "Go from your country AND your kindred, AND your father's house".

7. proofread There are several other examples like this in the bible where we tend to add to the Word of God or twist it just so slightly, do you remember in Exodus when Moses was to "speak" to the rock but he struck it a second time.  God still fulfilled His promise, and water flowed but for Moses's disobedience he was not allowed to enter the land.

8. Even through our disobedience God will fulfill His promises, ALWAYS. But our disobedience has consequences, take Abram's disobedience with Lot, if he told Lot to not come, well there wouldn't be a story about him and this blog post. Lot would have ended up living his normal life back in the land of the Chaldeans possibly in a pagan fallen state, not knowing the God of Abram and becoming Lot the righteous.

9. Provide a subheading title for the above, something like Abram's consequences

10. Conclusion: God will accomplish what He wants, and will use disobedient people to do it if He has to.

11. help provide a conclusion to the background of the story of Lot using the above conclusion line

12. can you rewrite this: This is not in the text, but I suggest that Abram was called out of pagan worship and into service of the one true Living God in verse 1, and Abram introduced the Living God to Lot on their journey into the promised land, both leaving behind their pagan idols.

13. rewrite this as well: In my next post in this series, we will continue to examine the life of Lot and how it parallels the lives of American Christians of today

14. Analysis the blog post so far: From Disobedience to Redemption: Unveiling Lot's Impact on American Christians - Background  Introduction: Wow! It is truly remarkable how an apparently insignificant character like Lot can leave an indelible mark on the biblical narrative. His story is not only recorded in the Old Testament but also in the New Testament, demanding our attention and reflection. In this blog post, we delve into the profound lessons from Lot's journey, with a focus on awakening the complacent American Christian and urging them to return to their heavenly Father.  Bible Verses  Genesis 12:1 Now the Lord said to Abram, ‚ÄúGo from your country, And from your relatives And from your father‚Äôs house, To the land which I will show you;.." (NASB2020)  Genesis 12:4 So Abram went away as the Lord had spoken to him; and Lot went with him. (NASB2020) 2 Peter 2:7-8 - Lot's Anchor verses 7 and if He rescued righteous Lot, who was oppressed by the perverted conduct of unscrupulous people  8 (for by what he saw and heard that righteous man, while living among them, felt his righteous soul tormented day after day by their lawless deeds),      Abram's Disobedience The two Genesis verses introduce us to Abram and his nephew Lot. However, they also highlight our inherent sinfulness that often hinders our complete obedience to God. Can you spot the sin in these verses? Abram was instructed to "Go from your country AND your kindred, AND your father's house."  In these verses, the sin lies in Abram's partial obedience to God's command. Instead of completely separating himself from his country, kindred, and father's house, Abram took his nephew Lot along with him.   There are several other examples like this in the Bible where we tend to add to the Word of God or twist it ever so slightly. Do you remember in Exodus when Moses was instructed to "speak" to the rock, but instead, he struck it a second time? God, in His faithfulness, still fulfilled His promise, and water flowed from the rock. However, due to Moses's disobedience, he was not allowed to enter the Promised Land.  Consequences of Disobedience: Unveiling the Impact of Abram's Choices Even in the midst of our disobedience, God remains faithful to fulfill His promises. However, it is important to recognize that our disobedience does carry consequences. Let's consider Abram's disobedience in his relationship with Lot. If Abram had followed God's instructions and not allowed Lot to accompany him, their stories would have taken different paths.  Had Lot remained in the land of the Chaldeans, he might have continued living his normal life, unaware of the God of Abram and remaining in a fallen, pagan state. The narrative of Lot's transformation into a righteous individual would not have unfolded.  While it is not explicitly stated in the text, it is plausible to suggest that Abram's calling in Genesis 12:1 involved a departure from pagan worship and a summons into the service of the one true Living God. As Abram embarked on his journey, he not only left behind his own idols but also had the opportunity to introduce the Living God to his nephew Lot, as they ventured together into the promised land.  Conclusion:  Lot's presence in the biblical narrative, stemming from Abram's initial disobedience, reveals the intricate ways in which God works through flawed human choices. Despite the consequences of disobedience, God's overarching plan remained intact, and He brought about transformation and redemption in Lot's life.  NEXT Installment of this series  Stay tuned as we unravel the compelling narrative of Lot and its significance for the lives of American Christians today. Together, we will uncover the timeless truths that can inspire and empower us to live faithfully and wholeheartedly for God in our contemporary context.

28. Can you help me with rewriting just this portion of the blog post: Lot, an apparently insignificant character, is mentioned in both the beginning chapters of the Old Testament as well as referenced in the New Testament. Although Lot's story seems to be insignificant compared to the other heroes of the bible, I believe his story calls us as American Christians back to the foot of the cross in repentence as we have grown comfortable with our so called Christian liberties

29. How about this one:  Throughout this series, we will not only examine the biblical narrative but also draw parallels to our lives as contemporary believers. We will uncover the relevance of Lot's story for American Christians today, challenging us to confront complacency and rekindle our passion to become radically obedient to God, and to enjoy Him forever and ever.

30. Try not to repeat the same thing in these 2 paragraphs but keep the emphasis ie.. strong conviction for the American Christian to seek repentance at the foot of the cross as well as the reference to the Westminsiter confession number 1.   Lot, a seemingly unremarkable figure, is mentioned in the early chapters of the Old Testament and even, and I think his anchor character verse (2 Pet. 2:7-8) finds a place of reference in the New Testament. While his story may appear overshadowed by the prominent heroes of the Bible, it carries a powerful message that resonates with us as American Christians. In a time where we have grown complacent in our pursuit of Christian liberties, Lot's narrative serves as a poignant call to return to the foot of the cross in sincere repentance. In this blog post, we embark on a journey to uncover the timeless wisdom found within the life of Lot, exploring themes of disobedience, redemption, and the transformative power of God's grace.  Throughout this series, we embark on a profound exploration of the biblical narrative surrounding Lot, transcending time and drawing compelling parallels to our lives as contemporary believers. Brace yourself for an enlightening journey that unveils the timeless relevance of Lot's story for American Christians today. Prepare to confront the lurking shadow of complacency, as we are challenged to reignite our passion for radical obedience to God, embracing a life of wholehearted devotion and experiencing the eternal joy of knowing and enjoying Him forevermore.

Here is what I have so far for the summary opening statement for the first of the series  In this first installment, From Disobedience to Redemption, we examine the calling of Abram, the obedience and disobedience of Abram, and end up with the journey into the land of Caanan (Gen 12:1-10, Acts 7:2-7), and expound on the calling of Lot to the One True Living God. Scripture doesn't speak of Lot's conversion but based on our own conversions I will try to paint the picture that "Angels rejoice in Heaven" over

42. I'm going to add this section to Part 1 can you help me rewrite this section only:  Honor thy Father and Mother We are actually going to back up a little bit and provide a history lesson, as well as insight into the character of God.  For context read Genesis Chapter 11: 27-32, and Acts 7:2-7. Do you see how the events transpired?  Abram was spoken to by God while he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran (Acts 7:2).  Terah took his son Abram and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson to his ancestrial hometown of Haran (Terah named his 3rd son after his hometown). (Gen. 11:31). Now the trip was initiated by Teran, who by the way was a pagan worshipper (Josh 24:2). So it seems that the "Living God" directed Teran to venture back home for one reason or another.  Point being God made heading to the land that He promised an easier choice for Abram.  However Abram did not depart from his father's house (Haran), till after his father died, and then he set out for the land of Canaan.  This brings me to this point, "If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself." (2 Timothy 2:13, NASB2020).  Which in this case God wouldn't tell Abram leave your relatives and go, He also states we are to honor our father and mother, with Abram instructions he was to leave all of it behind but he couldn't dishonor his father, so God worked it out.  He sent them closer west to the land and Abram waited till his father died before leaving.  Interesting how that all worked out.

43. Can you provide paragraph headings for the 1st 2 paragraphs, and also a title for the 3rd paragraph

44. Can we examine this a bit, let God speak to you in His Word, what is He saying to you. Abram waited for his father to pass before his journey. Reflect on that, doesn't it bring up the verse about honoring your father and mother?

45. Now look into your own life, can you see His direct intervention in your own life.  For me I saw the day I came to faith.  He directly intervened, when he assigned my dorm room to a christian roommate.  It was originally across the hall, but the other person moved in that morning.

46. can you rephrase my statement above

47. can you help rephrase this using scripture references for the context I provide: The best I can do for those of you that are reading this is to proclaim the Gospel, the good news is in this book, the Holy Bible.  God speaks to you in His word, and if this history lesson has spoken to you, please do not ignore what He is saying, get on your knees and tell Him I believe what you say in your Word.  That's it, nothing more complex than that.  However as you examine the Word you will find that you are a sinner, needing forgiveness.  Jesus (God's Son) paid that penalty for you.  And here is another hint, Jesus is the Word, the Way, the Truth and the Life.  In Him you will have life, and life abundantly

48. Verse reference for : "faith comes from hearing, and hearing from the Word of God."

49. Word Count: Unveiling Lot's Impact on American Christians  Introduction: Welcome to my first blog post (ever) where we will examine the life of Lot, diving deep into both the Old and New Testaments to unravel the profound lessons hidden within the scriptures about this inconsequential character. We will explore the themes of disobedience, redemption, and the transformative power of God's grace as they unfold in Lot's story.  Throughout this series, we will examine this biblical narrative and draw parallels to our lives as contemporary believers. We will uncover the relevance of Lot's story for American Christians today, challenging us to confront complacency and rekindle our passion to become radically obedient to God.  Part 1: Lot's family history In this first installment, we begin by looking at the history of Lot's beginnings, Abram's disobedience, and God's sovereign plan to bring redemption to Lot. Through careful examination, we will reveal God's unwavering commitment to His redemptive purposes.  Let's begin by looking at the key verses for Part 1 in this series.  Bible Verses (NASB2020)  Genesis 12:1 Now the Lord said to Abram, ‚ÄúGo from your country, And from your relatives And from your father‚Äôs house, To the land which I will show you;.."  Genesis 12:4 So Abram went away as the Lord had spoken to him; and Lot went with him. 2 Peter 2:7-8 - Lot's Anchor verses 7 and if He rescued righteous Lot, who was oppressed by the perverted conduct of unscrupulous people  8 (for by what he saw and heard that righteous man, while living among them, felt his righteous soul tormented day after day by their lawless deeds),      Lot's family historical significance To gain a deeper understanding of God's character and the unfolding events, let's take a step back and delve into a historical lesson. It's important to read Genesis Chapter 11:27-32 and Acts 7:2-7 for context. As we examine the sequence of events, we discover that God spoke to Abram while he was still in Mesopotamia, prior to his residence in Haran (Acts 7:2). Terah, Abram's father, took Abram and Lot, his grandson, back to their ancestral hometown of Haran (Terah had named his third son after the city) (Genesis 11:31).  Interestingly, Terah, being a pagan worshipper (Joshua 24:2), was seemingly directed by the "Living God" to return to his homeland for reasons unknown to us. It appears that God made it easier for Abram to choose the path leading to the promised land. However, Abram did not depart from his father's house (Haran) until after his father's passing, and then he embarked on the journey to the land of Canaan.  God's Faithfulness  This brings us to a crucial point emphasized in 2 Timothy 2:13: "If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself" (NASB2020). In this case it seems that God spoke prophetically to Abram, when He said to "And from your father's house", so when they moved to Heran, he would actually be leaving his father's ancestral home. Abram will be leaving all family lineage and starting the family line of David, the line of Promise. It's truly fascinating how all the pieces fell into place, displaying God's faithfulness and wisdom.  Can we examine this a bit, let God speak to you in His Word, what is He saying to you. The fact that Abram waited for his father to pass before embarking on his journey to the promised land indeed raises a thought-provoking connection to the commandment of honoring one's father and mother. In Exodus 20:12, we find the instruction, "Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be prolonged in the land which the LORD your God gives you." And this scripture hadn't been even written yet, showing the Divine directly interacting with His creation to accomplish His perfect will.  Upon reflecting on my own life, I can vividly see God's direct intervention in a specific moment: the day I came to faith. His hand was unmistakably at work when He orchestrated the assignment of my dorm room, aligning it with a Christian roommate. Originally I was slated to be placed across the hall, however an unexpected change occurred that very morning, resulting in my placement with my now Christian brother.  This divine intervention holds a very dear meaning to me as I recognize God's intentional involvement in guiding my spiritual journey. The precise timing of my dorm room placement and the faith-filled atmosphere that (Dave) brought created an environment where my faith could flourish and grow. It serves as a tangible reminder of God's personal care and His desire to draw me closer to Himself.  Conclusion:  The best I can offer to all who are reading this is to proclaim the Gospel, for the good news is contained within the Holy Bible, the Word of God. As you engage with the history lesson we have explored, I urge you not to disregard the message God is speaking to you. In humility, declare to Him, "I believe in the truth revealed in Your Word." This simple act of "faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ." (Romans 10:17, NASB)  As you dive deeper into the Scriptures, you will come to realize your own sinful nature and desperate need for forgiveness. It is through Jesus, God's Son, that this forgiveness is made possible. Jesus is not only the One who paid the penalty for your sins, but He is also the embodiment of the Word, the Way, the Truth, and the Life. In Him, you will discover true life‚Äîa life that is abundant and overflowing with God's blessings.  Embracing Jesus as your Lord and Savior is the key to experiencing the abundant life He offers. The Scriptures bear witness to His redemptive work and serve as a guide to understanding His teachings and the path to salvation.  Stay tuned for the upcoming parts of this series:  Part 2: From Disobedience to Redemption Part 3: The Perils of Carnality Part 4: The Torment of a Righteous Soul Part 5: The Path to Restoration

The fact that Abram waited for his father to pass before embarking on his journey to the promised land indeed raises a thought-provoking connection to the commandment of honoring one's father and mother. In Exodus 20:12, we find the instruction, "Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be prolonged in the land which the LORD your God gives you." And this scripture hadn't been even written yet, showing the Divine directly interacting with His creation to accomplish His perfect will.  Upon reflecting on my own life, I can vividly see God's direct intervention in a specific moment: the day I came to faith. His hand was unmistakably at work when He orchestrated the assignment of my dorm room, aligning it with a Christian roommate. Originally I was slated to be placed across the hall, however an unexpected change occurred that very morning, resulting in my placement with my now Christian brother.  This divine intervention holds a very dear meaning to me as I recognize God's intentional involvement in guiding my spiritual journey. The precise timing of my dorm room placement and the faith-filled atmosphere that (Dave) brought created an environment where my faith could flourish and grow. It serves as a tangible reminder of God's personal care and His desire to draw me closer to Himself.  Conclusion:  The best I can offer to all who are reading this is to proclaim the Gospel, for the good news is contained within the Holy Bible, the Word of God. As you engage with the history lesson we have explored, I urge you not to disregard the message God is speaking to you. In humility, declare to Him, "I believe in the truth revealed in Your Word." This simple act of "faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ." (Romans 10:17, NASB)  As you dive deeper into the Scriptures, you will come to realize your own sinful nature and desperate need for forgiveness. It is through Jesus, God's Son, that this forgiveness is made possible. Jesus is not only the One who paid the penalty for your sins, but He is also the embodiment of the Word, the Way, the Truth, and the Life. In Him, you will discover true life‚Äîa life that is abundant and overflowing with God's blessings.  Embracing Jesus as your Lord and Savior is the key to experiencing the abundant life He offers. The Scriptures bear witness to His redemptive work and serve as a guide to understanding His teachings and the path to salvation.  Stay tuned for the upcoming parts of this series:  Part 2: From Disobedience to Redemption Part 3: The Perils of Carnality Part 4: The Torment of a Righteous Soul Part 5: The Path to Restoration

54. Can I post this in Facebook in it's entirety

55. Is there a better blog tool to use than google blogger

56. I am going to tackle the 2nd part of this blog post entitled: From Disobedience to Redemption what can you provide for this topic based on the scripture references for Lot and I believe he came to redemption on the way to the city, possibly through the witness of Abram

57. I'm posting another blog entry can you proofread and fix any grammatical and flow issues?  What we have seen and heard Read Acts 4, Luke 24:44-49 Acts 4:20 "for we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard."    In this passage, Peter said "We cannot stop" speaking about what he has seen and heard. Not that He will try, or in disobedience to the Priests, but that he cannot, because God has commanded him to testify to what he has seen and heard.  If you don't believe me it is all over the NT of the Bible.  We are commanded to testify about what we have seen and heard.    Peter is referring to another section in Luke's gospel  Luke 24:44-49 44 Now He said to them, "These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled."  45 Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,  46 and He said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise again from the dead the third day,  47 and that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.  48 "You are witnesses of these things.  49 "And behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."    Then He opened their minds to the Scriptures, and not many days later they were "clothed with power from on high"  Back in Acts 4:8 "Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit," began to teach.    Witness - what we have seen and heard Question: Regarding Jesus of Nazareth, the Messiah, Lamb of God, our Redeemer, your personal Lord and Savior; what are you witnesses of?  If you were in a court room and had to testify to your belief in Jesus as your redeemer what can you testify to what you have seen and heard about Him personally.  To put it plainly "What am I a witness of?"    I'm not asking of your personal testimony (although that can be part of it), or your assurance of salvation, my question here is more of a recent walk of faith you are having.  Ask yourself "What am I a witness of? (Regarding my Savior, what can I testify to anyone about Him?) To do this  1. First ask God to clothe you with His Spirit and let Him open your mind to the things which you have seen and heard about Himself in your life.  2. Think of how God has revealed Himself to you recently, it could be this past year, 6 months, this month etc.  3. Write them down, What you saw, what you heard and what you felt.    Spend today doing that, asking God how have you revealed yourself to me lately?     If nothing comes to mind, maybe write down when you came to know Him, maybe a favorite verse and explain why, or a song, Hymn and why .    Writing down anything will only re-enforce your confidence in your belief in Him. Ask God daily to reveal Himself to you Look back at what you wrote and let it be your testimony, maybe keep a journal, or a private blog   2 Corinthians 10:7 7 You are looking at things as they are outwardly . If anyone is confident in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again within himself, that just as he is Christ's, so also are we.   Hymn "I know Whom I have believed" "I know not why God's wondrous grace  To me He hath made known,  Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love  Redeemed me for His own.    But "I know whom I have believed  And am persuaded that He is able  To keep that which I've committed  Unto Him against that day."

58. Proclaim the Truth - Make disciples The additional thing Peter did with his first sermon was proclaim the truth of God's word.  He quoted several Old Testament passages during this sermon and proclaimed the gospel, I might add it was to a Jewish audience that knew the law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms by heart.  So when explained it to them those that were appointed believed

59. Final Note If you are struggling with whether or not God is using you or if you are a Christian or not... Well then... I know you are a Christian.  Trust me, or trust God, if you have those types of questions then I are, you can take that to the bank, literally take it to the bank or the store or your neighbor.  I am a Christian, a child of God.  Do you want to know who He is?

60. I am creating a new post on a facebook page I have designed for our ministry page.  It is a beginning post but it is not necessarily a beginning type post, it is more of in the middle of our Ministry

61. Here is my post: Have you seen the TV show on Discovery called Gold Rush?  It is where they show several different miners using different methods of extracting gold from the earth.  They design their extractors to catch as much fine gold as possible, and along the way they find small nuggets as well. In 1 Corinthians chapter 3 it talks about planting and who waters, plants and sows all may be a different person but the result is "God causes the growth" (scripture reference from you chatgpt please). At the end the worker is put through the fire and all his work is tested, either gold, silver, precious stones or wood, hay and stubble. Our walk on this journey can either be filled with fine gold with a few nuggets mixed in or it could be just an occassional gold nugget, or stones.  Or to the worst case, all our works be burned up, but to be saved as through fire. Our ministry has been seen so far to be moments of fine gold recovery.  It takes a lot of work and calculated risks to be able to be successful at catching fine gold.  Nan and I try to prepare for the fine gold by asking God to give us opportunity each day.  We have had so many encounters with people

## Centralized Job Role Optimization

1. I want to ask a question and I don't want it to be offensive in any way and I want it to be answered by high level executives so I don't want to sound condescending or anything like that.  My question to ask is this:  I noticed we have two organizations that are doing the same jobs, both are needed however and 1 organization is internal offering as the 2nd org is External offering.  So with this in mind the 2nd org is defining their roles, instead of using the role definitions already in place by the 1st organization, wouldn't it be better to keep the 2 orgs but use a central Job role definition for both, making minor tweaks to fit individual needs?

2. this is a slack message, can I start it with "I have a question about Job definitions/roles common across our company"

4. please come up with a database called initialData in JavaScript object format that would include the following properties:  articles which would be an array that would contain objects and each object would have an id, avatar, name, image, likes, comments, commentCount. Add 5 different objects in the array of articles

5. when I console.log(articlesArray) I get {} [[Prototype]] :  Object I am not able to review individual article id properties in console.log

6. Instead I did export default initialData; and then in App.js I did import initialData from .. and then console.log(initialData.articles[0].name) and that worked

7. can you recommend where I can find sample avatar pictures and instagram images used for my testing environment on the web

8. how about stock images that are formatted to avatar thumbnail size and instagram 500x500px sizes

9. given the following code what is an efficient way to display  in a scrollable list view in react native: (please focus on the data articles objects specifically likes, name, comments): import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar'; import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native'; import initialData from './assets/instagram-feed/Data'; export default function App() {   return (     <View style={styles.container}>       {console.log(initialData.articles[0].name)}       <Text>Instagram Feed Application</Text>       <StatusBar style="auto" />     </View>   ); } const styles = StyleSheet.create({   container: {     flex: 1,     backgroundColor: '#fff',     alignItems: 'center',     justifyContent: 'center',   }, });

10. given the following code, I'm expecting to display image in Data.js but the image is not loading, please review and fix: import { StyleSheet, Text, View, FlatList, StatusBar, Image } from 'react-native'; import initialData from './assets/instagram-feed/Data';  export default function App() {   return (     <View style={styles.container}>       <Text>Instagram Feed Application</Text>       <FlatList         data={initialData.articles}         keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}         showsVerticalScrollIndicator={false}         renderItem={({ item }) => (           <View style={styles.articleContainer}>             <Image style={styles.image} source={item.image} />             <Text style={styles.name}>{item.name}</Text>             <Text style={styles.likes}>Likes: {item.likes}</Text>             <Text style={styles.comments}>Comments: {item.commentCount}</Text>           </View>         )}       />       <StatusBar style="auto" />     </View>   ); }

11. The images are stored in ./assets/instagram-feed-images/ folder will this change the above code?

12. when using the code you provided I receive errors adding numbers to the end of my images: .*$:18 Uncaught Error: Cannot find module './/static/media/CAM00687.375ff1798d0e3ce95bf7.jpg'

13. hmm.. switched it back to:           <View style={styles.articleContainer}>             <Image style={styles.image} source={item.image} />             <Text style={styles.name}>{item.name}</Text>             <Text style={styles.likes}>Likes: {item.likes}</Text>             <Text style={styles.comments}>Comments: {item.commentCount}</Text>           </View>

14. and that worked

15. given the following code update the comments key value dynamically with the commentCount value of each object in the articles array and return the new data in a new variable called data: const initialData = {     profile: {       avatar: require("../instagram-feed-images/Profile.png")     },     stories: [       {         id:1,         avatar: require("../instagram-feed-images/Profile.png"),         name: 'James Brown',         isSeen: false,       },       {         id:2,         avatar: require("../instagram-feed-images/Profile.png"),         name: 'Big Wave Dave',         isSeen: true,       },       {         id:3,         avatar: require("../instagram-feed-images/Profile.png"),         name: 'Big Wave Dave',         isSeen:false,       },     ],     articles: [       {         id: 1,         avatar: require("../instagram-feed-images/Profile.png"),         name: 'James Brown',         image: require("../instagram-feed-images/CAM00687.jpg"),         likes: 4,         comments: 'View all 0 comments',         commentCount: 16       },       {         id: 2,         avatar: require("../instagram-feed-images/Profile.png"),         name: 'John Doe',         image: require("../instagram-feed-images/CAM00683.jpg"),         likes: 34,         comments: 'View all 0 comments',         commentCount: 23       },       {         id: 3,         avatar: require("../instagram-feed-images/Profile.png"),         name: 'Brittany Doe',         image: require("../instagram-feed-images/CAM00684.jpg"),         likes: 112,         comments: 'View all 0 comments',         commentCount: 13       },       {         id: 4,         avatar: require("../instagram-feed-images/Profile.png"),         name: 'Big Wave Dave',         image: require("../instagram-feed-images/CAM00685.jpg"),         likes: 45,         comments: 'View all 0 comments',         commentCount: 23       },       {         id: 5,         avatar: require("../instagram-feed-images/Profile.png"),         name: 'Airman Haines',         image: require("../instagram-feed-images/CAM00686.jpg"),         likes: 102,         comments: 'View all 0 comments',         commentCount: 3       },     ] };  // You can access the articles array like this: export default initialData;

6. Can you help me write a cv or resume for this position, I already provided a resume already would it be okay to provide an updated version with my interview

7. I may want to create a document that highlights some accomplishments that revolve around this position

8. I have 2 accomplishments that I would like to provide, can you write out this resume addendem based on the structure you just provided?   Here is the information on my accomplishments: Previous Accomplishments as an OS/2 Warp engineer - Information Developer - Foundational Knowledge of Z components  OS/2 Warp REXX programming for imaging systems - Micron Technology 1989-2007 As an OS/2 Warp platform engineer, I provided computers installed with OS/2 Warp, fully networked, remote control access, and network shared configured systems for imaging systems at Micron. These imaging systems used REXX programming to upload images to Micron servers for processing.  It also programmed to run the imaging tool and automated the image capture process.  It read the wafer IDs, used OCR to name the image files. I collaborated successfully with a team to develop this imaging capture system that used OCR to identify individual wafers, label the file associated with that wafer, and upload images to Micron servers for defect analysis. The team consisted of a platform engineer (myself), programmer with REXX programming skills ( I assisted in code verification ) and a team of imaging engineers for testing the system.   OS/2 Warp Computing platform for Furnace systems - Micron Technology 1989-2007 I provided OS/2 Warp compute platforms for the A400 furnace systems as an automation system that was fully networked and accessed remotely.  These upgraded systems provided the necessary computing power to allow the computer to read the pitch of the furnace baffle as it was loading in the furnace, and determine if the wafers were going to scrape the edge of the quartz tube.  This computer eliminated the problem in saving several millions of dollars in wasted silicon wafers and quartz tubes.  I worked with 3rd party vendor of the ASM A400 furnace, several furnace engineers, I again provided the fully networked OS/2 Warp platform. It provided NFS storage access to engineering Windows NT systems, Remote control software to connect to each MSCII systems (OS/2 Warp system). I also scripted monitoring, network backup, and keep alive scripts which would send an email reporting the status of each system. It provided remote access so the engineers can view it in real time and make adjustments to the system in realtime

9. Can you provide an extended sample of REXX code
