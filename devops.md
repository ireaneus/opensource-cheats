# Devops meaning

[Back](README.md) to Linux CheatSheets by Ireaneus

*Devops meaning: Devops is a cultural sensibility.  It's a unified metrics based approach to making software efficiently and fearlessly using as much automation as possible.*

*Sadly many companies don't have the will or discipline to foster a true DevOps culture, so they come up with the term "DevOps Engineer" to make it seem as if the DevOps sensibility has taken hold.*

*In reality they're just looking for infrastructure engineers who know how to work AWS or Google Cloud*
